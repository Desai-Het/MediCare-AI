Throughout life, variations in the positions of organs\\nare dependent not only on gravity but also on the movements of the hollow viscera, which induce\\nfurther changes in shape when filling and emptying. The need to recognize the relationships of the\\nviscera to the abdominal regions becomes most apparent when taking into account the distortion that\\noccurs during pregnancy. For example, the appendix lies in the right ilioinguinal region (right lower\\nquadrant) until the 12th week of gestation. At 16 weeks, it is at the level of the right iliac crest. At 20\\nweeks, it is at the level of the umbilicus, where it will remain until after delivery. Because of this\\ndisplacement, the symptoms of appendicitis will be different during the 3 trimesters. Similarly,\\ndisplacement will also affect problems involving the bowel.\\nSkin, Subcutaneous Tissue, & Fascia\\nThe abdominal skin is smooth, fine, and very elastic. It is loosely attached to underlying structures\\nexcept at the umbilicus, where it is firmly adherent. Langer’s lines are lines of tension based on the\\norientation of dermal fibers in the skin. On the anterior abdominal wall, these lines are arranged\\nmostly in a transverse fashion. As a consequence, vertical incisions heal under more tension and\\ntherefore have a propensity to develop into wider scars. This is more noticeable in those patients who\\ntend to form keloids. Conversely, transverse incisions, like a Pfannenstiel, heal with a much better\\ncosmetic appearance.\\nBeneath the skin is the superficial fascia (tela subcutanea). This fatty protective fascia covers the\\nentire abdomen. Below the navel, it consists principally of 2 layers: Camper’s fascia, the more\\nsuperficial layer containing most of the fat; and Scarpa’s fascia (deep fascia), the fibroelastic\\nmembrane firmly attached to midline aponeuroses and to the fascia lata.\\nArteries\\nArteries of the Upper Abdomen\\nThe lower 5 intercostal arteries (\\nFig. 1–3\\n) and the subcostal artery accompany the thoracic nerves.\\nTheir finer, terminal branches enter the rectus sheath to anastomose with the superior and inferior'),\n",

Superficial veins and arteries of abdomen.\\nThe inferior epigastric artery, a branch of the external iliac artery, usually arises just above the\\ninguinal ligament and passes on the medial side of the round ligament to the abdominal inguinal ring.\\nFrom there, it ascends in a slightly medial direction, passing above and lateral to the subcutaneous\\ninguinal ring, which lies between the fascia transversalis \\nand the peritoneum. Piercing the fascia\\ntransversalis, it passes in front of the linea semicircularis, turns upward between the rectus and its\\nsheath, enters the substance of the rectus muscle, and meets the superior epigastric artery. The\\nsuperior epigastric supplies the upper central abdominal wall, the inferior supplies the lower central\\npart of the anterior abdominal wall, and the deep circumflex supplies the lower lateral part of the\\nabdominal wall.\\nArteries of the Lower Abdomen\\nThe deep circumflex iliac artery is also a branch of the external iliac artery, arising from its side either\\nopposite the epigastric artery or slightly below the origin of that vessel. It courses laterally behind the\\ninguinal ligament lying between the fascia transversalis and the peritoneum. The deep circumflex\\nartery perforates the transversus near the anterior superior spine of the ilium and continues between\\nthe transversus and internal oblique along and slightly above the crest of the ilium, finally running\\nposteriorly to anastomose with the iliolumbar artery. A branch of the deep circumflex iliac artery is\\nimportant to the surgeon because it forms anastomoses with branches of the inferior epigastric.\\nThe various incisions on the abdomen encounter some muscle planes and vasculature of clinical\\nsignificance. The McBurney incision requires separation of the external and internal oblique muscles\\nand splitting of the transversus. The deep circumflex artery may be frequently encountered. The\\nparamedian incision is made in the right or left rectus. Below the arcuate line, the fascia of the\\nexternal and internal oblique, as well as the transversus muscles when present, goes over the rectus\\nabdominis; above the arcuate line, the transversus and part of the internal oblique go under the rectus.\\nThe vasculature is primarily perforators and frequently the thoracoabdominal vein. Inferiorly, the\\nsuperficial epigastric may be encountered.\\nIn the Pfannenstiel or low transverse incision, the fascia of the external and internal oblique goes\\nover the rectus muscle as well as the transversus muscle when present. After the fascia over the rectus\\nis incised, the muscles can \\nbe separated. The superficial epigastric artery and vein are encountered in\\nCamper’s fascia. Laterally, the superficial and deep circumflex iliac arteries may be at the margin of\\nthe incision.

Abdominal incisions are shown in \\nFigure 1–4\\n. The\\nposition of the muscles influences the type of incision to be made. The aim is to adequately expose the\\noperative field, avoiding damage to parietal structures, blood vessels, and nerves.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Figure 1–7\\n. Musculature of abdominal wall.\\nFunction of Abdominal Muscles\\nIn general, the functions of the abdominal muscles are 3-fold: (1) support and compression of the\\nabdominal viscera by the external oblique, internal oblique, and transversus muscles; (2) depression of\\nthe thorax in conjunction with the diaphragm by the rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal\\noblique, and transversus muscles, as evident in respiration, coughing, vomiting, defecation, and\\nparturition; and (3) assistance in bending movements of the trunk through flexion of the vertebral\\ncolumn by the rectus abdominis, external oblique, and internal oblique muscles. There is partial\\nassistance in rotation of the thorax and upper abdomen to the same side when the pelvis is fixed by the\\ninternal oblique and by the external oblique to the opposite side. In addition, the upper external\\noblique serves as a fixation muscle in abduction of the upper limb of the same side and adduction of\\nthe upper limb of the opposite side. The pyramidalis muscle secures the linea alba in the median line.\\nExternal Oblique Muscle\\nThe external oblique muscle consists of 8 pointed digitations attached to the lower 8 ribs. The lowest\\nfibers insert into the anterior half of the iliac crest and the inguinal ligament. At the linea alba, the\\nmuscle aponeurosis interdigitates with that of the opposite side and fuses with the underlying internal\\noblique.\\nInternal Oblique Muscle\\nThe internal oblique muscle arises from thoracolumbar fascia, the crest of the ilium, and the inguinal\\nligament. Going in the opposite oblique direction, the muscle inserts into the lower 3 costal cartilages\\nand into the linea alba on either side of the rectus abdominis. The aponeurosis helps to form the rectus'),\n",

The posterior layer extends from the rectus muscle rib\\ninsertions to below the umbilicus.\\nTransversus Muscle\\nThe transversus muscle, the fibers of which run transversely and arise from the inner surfaces of the\\nlower 6 costal cartilages, the thoracolumbar fascia, the iliac crest, and the inguinal ligament, lies\\nbeneath the internal oblique. By inserting into the linea alba, the aponeurosis of the transversus fuses\\nto form the posterior layer of the posterior rectus sheath. The termination of this layer is called the\\narcuate line, and below it lies the transversalis fascia, preperitoneal fat, and peritoneum. Inferiorly, the\\nthin aponeurosis of the transversus abdominis becomes part of the anterior rectus sheath.\\nRectus Muscles\\nThe rectus muscles are straplike and extend from the thorax to the pubis. They are divided by the linea\\nalba and outlined laterally by the linea semilunaris. Three tendinous intersections cross the upper part\\nof each rectus muscle, and a fourth may also be present below the umbilicus. The pyramidalis muscle,\\na vestigial muscle, is situated anterior to \\nthe lowermost part of the rectus muscle. It arises from and\\ninserts into the pubic periosteum. Beneath the superficial fascia and overlying the muscles is the thin,\\nsemitransparent deep fascia. Its extensions enter and divide the lateral muscles into coarse bundles.\\nSpecial Structures\\nThere are several special anatomic structures in the abdominal wall, including the umbilicus, linea\\nalba, linea semilunaris, and rectus sheath.\\nUmbilicus\\nThe umbilicus is positioned opposite the disk space between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae,\\napproximately 2 cm below the midpoint of a line drawn from the sternoxiphoid process to the top of\\nthe pubic symphysis. The umbilicus is a dense, wrinkled mass of fibrous tissue enclosed by and fused\\nwith a ring of circular aponeurotic fibers in the linea alba. Normally, it is the strongest part of the\\nabdominal wall. It also represents the shortest distance between the skin and the abdominal cavity, and\\nit is the most common place to enter the abdomen with the primary trochar when performing\\nlaparoscopic surgery.\\nLinea Alba\\nThe linea alba, a fibrous band formed by the fusion of the aponeuroses of the muscles of the anterior\\nabdominal wall, marks the medial side of the rectus abdominis; the linea semilunaris forms the lateral\\nborder, which courses from the tip of the ninth costal cartilage to the pubic tubercle. The linea alba\\nextends from the xiphoid process to the pubic symphysis, represented above the umbilicus as a\\nshallow median groove on the surface.\\nRectus Sheath & Aponeurosis of the External Oblique\\nThe rectus sheath serves to support and control the rectus muscles. It contains the rectus and\\npyramidalis muscles, the terminal branches of the lower 6 thoracic nerves and vessels, and the inferior\\nand superior epigastric vessels. Cranially, where the sheath is widest, its anterior wall extends upward\\nonto the thorax to the level of the fifth costal cartilage and is attached to the sternum.

The\\ntransition from aponeurosis to fascia usually is fairly sharp, marked by a curved line called the arcuate\\nline.\\nVariations of Abdominal Muscles\\nVariations have been noted in all of the abdominal muscles.\\nRectus Muscle\\nThe rectus abdominis muscle may differ in the number of its tendinous inscriptions and the extent of\\nits thoracic \\nattachment. Aponeurotic slips or slips of muscle on the upper part of the thorax are\\nremnants of a more primitive state in which the muscle extended to the neck. Absence of part or all of\\nthe muscle has been noted. The pyramidalis muscle may be missing, only slightly developed, double,\\nor extend upward to the umbilicus.\\nExternal Oblique Muscle\\nThe external oblique muscle varies in the extent of its origin from the ribs. Broad fascicles may be\\nseparated by loose tissue from the main belly of the muscle, either on its deep or on its superficial\\nsurface. The supracostalis anterior is a rare fascicle occasionally found on the upper portion of the\\nthoracic wall. Transverse tendinous inscriptions may also be found.\\nInternal Oblique Muscle\\nThe internal oblique deviates at times, both in its attachments and in the extent of development of the\\nfleshy part of the muscle. Occasionally, tendinous inscriptions are present, or the posterior division\\nforms an extra muscle 7–7.5 cm wide and separated from the internal oblique by a branch of the\\niliohypogastric nerve and a branch of the deep circumflex iliac artery.\\nTransversus Muscle\\nThe transversus muscle fluctuates widely in the extent of its development but is rarely absent. Rarely,\\nit extends as far inferiorly as the ligamentum teres uteri (round ligament), and infrequently, it is\\nsituated superior to the anterior superior spine.

The body is the\\nheaviest part of the bone and is joined with the bodies of the ilium and pubis to form the acetabulum.\\nIt presents 3 surfaces. (1) The smooth internal surface is continuous above with the body of the ilium\\nand below with the inner surface of the superior ramus of the ischium. Together, these parts form the\\nposterior portion of the lateral wall of the pelvis minor. (2) The external surface of the ischium is the\\nportion that enters into the formation of the acetabulum. (3) The posterior surface is the area between\\nthe acetabular rim and the posterior border. It is convex and is separated from the ischial tuberosity by\\na wide groove.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Pubis\\nThe pubis is composed of a body and 2 rami, superior and inferior. The body contributes to the\\nformation of the acetabulum, joining with the body of the ilium at the iliopectineal eminence and with\\nthe body of the ischium in the region of the acetabular notch. The superior ramus passes medially and\\nforward from the body to meet the corresponding ramus of the opposite side at the symphysis pubica.\\nThe medial or fore portion of the superior ramus is broad and flattened anteroposteriorly. Formerly\\ncalled “the body,” it presents an outer and an inner surface, the symphyseal area, and an upper border\\nor “crest.”\\nApproximately 2 cm from the medial edge of the ramus and in line with the upper border is the\\nprominent pubic tubercle, an important landmark. Below the crest are the anterior surface and the\\nposterior or deep surface. The medial portion of the superior ramus is continuous below with the\\ninferior ramus, and the lateral part presents a wide, smooth area anterosuperiorly, behind which is an\\nirregular ridge, the pecten ossis pubis. The pecten pubis forms the anterior part of the linea terminalis.\\nIn front of and below the pectineal area is the obturator crest, passing from the tubercle to the\\nacetabular notch. On the inferior aspect of the superior ramus is the obturator sulcus. The inferior\\nramus is continuous with the superior ramus and passes downward and backward to join the inferior\\nramus of the ischium, forming the “ischiopubic arch.” The pubis receives blood from the pubic\\nbranches of the obturator artery and from branches of the medial and lateral circumflex arteries.\\nPubic Symphysis\\nThe pubic symphysis is a synarthrodial joint of the symphyseal surfaces of the pubic bones. The\\nligaments associated \\nwith it are (1) the interpubic fibrocartilage, (2) the superior pubic ligament, (3)\\nthe anterior pubic ligament, and (4) the arcuate ligament. The interpubic fibrocartilage is thicker in\\nfront than behind and projects beyond the edges of the bones, especially on the posterior aspect,\\nblending intimately with the ligaments at its margins. Sometimes it is woven throughout, but often the\\ninterpubic fibrocartilage presents an elongated, narrow fissure with fluid in the interspace, partially\\ndividing the cartilage into 2 plates.\\nThe interpubic cartilage is intimately adherent to the layer of hyaline cartilage that covers the\\nsymphyseal surface of each pubic bone. The superior pubic ligament extends laterally along the crest\\nof the pubis on each side to the pubic tubercle, blending in the middle line with the interpubic\\ncartilage. The thick and strong anterior pubic ligament is closely connected with the fascial covering\\nof the muscles arising from the conjoined rami of the pubis. It consists of several strata of thick,\\ndecussating fibers of different degrees of obliquity, the superficial being the most oblique and\\nextending lowest over the joint. The arcuate ligament is a thick band of closely connected fibers that\\nfills the angle between the pubic rami to form a smooth, rounded top to the pubic arch. Both on the\\nanterior and posterior aspects of the joint, the ligament gives off decussating fibers that, interlacing\\nwith one another, strengthen the joint.\\nSacrum\\nThe sacrum is formed in the adult by the union of 5 or 6 sacral vertebrae; occasionally, the fifth\\nlumbar vertebra is partly fused with it. The process of union is known as “sacralization” in the\\nvertebral column. The sacrum constitutes the base of the vertebral column. As a single bone, it is\\nconsidered to have a base, an apex, 2 surfaces (pelvic and dorsal), and 2 lateral portions. The base\\nfaces upward and is composed principally of a central part, formed by the upper surface of the body of\\nthe first sacral vertebra, and 2 lateral areas of alae. The body articulates by means of a fibrocartilage\\ndisk with the body of the fifth lumbar vertebra. The alae represent the heavy transverse processes of'),\n",

The anterior margin of the body is called\\nthe promontory and forms the sacrovertebral angle with the fifth lumbar vertebra. The rounded\\nanterior margin of each ala constitutes the posterior part (pars sacralis) of the linea terminalis.\\nThe pelvic surface of the sacrum is rough and convex. In the midline is the median sacral crest\\n(fused spinal processes), and on either side is a flattened area formed by the fused laminae of the\\nsacral vertebrae. The laminae of the fifth vertebra and, in many cases, those of the fourth and\\noccasionally of the third are incomplete (the spines also are absent), thus leaving a wide opening to\\nthe dorsal wall of the sacral canal known as the sacral hiatus. Lateral to the laminae are the articular\\ncrests (right and left), which are in line with the paired superior articular processes above. The lateral\\nprocesses articulate with the inferior articular processes of the fifth lumbar vertebra. The inferior\\nextensions of the articular crests form the sacral cornua that bind the sacral hiatus laterally and are\\nattached to the cornua of the coccyx. The cornua can be palpated in life and are important landmarks\\nindicating the inferior opening of the sacral canal (for sacral-caudal anesthesia).\\nThe lateral portions of the sacrum are formed by the fusion of the transverse processes of the sacral\\nvertebrae. They form dorsally a line of elevations called the lateral sacral crests. The parts\\ncorresponding to the first 3 vertebrae are particularly massive and present a large area facing laterally\\ncalled the articular surface, which articulates with the sacrum. Posterior to the articular area, the rough\\nbone is called the sacral tuberosity. It faces the tuberosity of the ilium. The apex is the small area\\nformed by the lower surface of the body of the fifth part of the sacrum. The coccyx is formed by 4\\n(occasionally 3 or 5) caudal or coccygeal vertebrae. The second, third, and fourth parts are frequently\\nfused into a single bone that articulates with the first by means of a fibrocartilage. The entire coccyx\\nmay become ossified and fused with the sacrum (the sacrococcygeal joint).\\nThe sacrum receives its blood supply from the middle sacral artery, which extends from the\\nbifurcation of the aorta to the tip of the coccyx, and from the lateral sacral arteries that branch either\\nas a single artery that immediately divides or as 2 distinct vessels from the hypogastric artery. The\\nlowest lumbar branch of the middle sacral artery ramifies over the lateral parts of the sacrum, passing\\nback between the last vertebra and the sacrum to anastomose with the lumbar arteries above and the\\nsuperior gluteal artery below. The lateral sacral branches (usually 4) anastomose anteriorly to the\\ncoccyx with branches of the inferior lateral sacral artery that branch from the hypogastric artery. They\\ngive off small spinal branches that pass through the sacral foramens and supply the sacral canal and\\nposterior portion of the sacrum.\\nSacroiliac Joint\\nThe sacroiliac joint is a diarthrodial joint with irregular surfaces. The articular surfaces are covered\\nwith a layer of cartilage, and the cavity of the joint is a narrow cleft. The cartilage on the sacrum is\\nhyaline in its deeper parts but much thicker than that on the ilium. A joint capsule is attached to the\\nmargins of the articular surfaces, and the bones are held together by the anterior sacroiliac, long and\\nshort posterior sacroiliac, and interosseous ligaments. In addition, there are 3 ligaments (\\nFig. 1–11\\n),\\nclassed as belonging to the pelvic girdle itself, which also serve as accessory ligaments to the\\nsacroiliac joint: the iliolumbar, sacrotuberous, and sacrospinous ligaments.'),\n",

Straight side\\nwalls are characteristic of the anthropoid pelvis, whose interspinous and intertuberous diameters are\\nless than those of the average gynecoid pelvis. A medium bone structure is usual.\\nPlatypelloid\\nThe platypelloid pelvis has a distinct oval inlet with a very wide, rounded retropubic angle and a\\nwider, flat posterior segment. The sacrosciatic notch is narrow and has a normal sacral inclination,\\nalthough it is often short. The subpubic arch is very wide, and the side walls are straight, with wide\\ninterspinous and intertuberous diameters.\\nThe pelvis in any individual case may be one of the 4 “pure” types or a combination of mixed\\ntypes. When one discusses the intermediate pelvic forms, the posterior segment with its\\ncharacteristics generally is described first and the anterior segment with its characteristics next (eg,\\nanthropoid-gynecoid, android-anthropoid, or platypelloid-gynecoid). It is impossible to have a\\nplatypelloid-anthropoid pelvis or a platypelloid-android pelvis.\\nPelvic Relationships\\nSeveral important relationships should be remembered, beginning with those at the inlet of the pelvis.\\nThe transverse diameter of the inlet is the widest diameter, where bone is present for a circumference\\nof 360 degrees. This diameter stretches from pectineal line to pectineal line and denotes the separation\\nof the posterior and anterior segments of the pelvis. In classic pelves (gynecoid), a vertical plane\\ndropped from the transverse diameter of the inlet passes through the level of the interspinous diameter\\nat the ischial spine.\\nThese relationships may not hold true, however, in combination or intermediate (mixed type)\\npelves. The anterior transverse diameter of the inlet reaches from pectineal prominence to pectineal\\nprominence; a vertical plane dropped from the anterior transverse passes through the ischial\\ntuberosities. For good function of the pelvis, the anterior transverse diameter should never be more\\nthan 2 cm longer than the transverse diameter (\\nFig. 1–13\\n).\\nFigure 1–13\\n.

It is\\nrepresented by a line \\ndrawn from the posterior superior portion of the pubic symphysis (where bone\\nexists for a circumference of 360 degrees) toward intersection with the sacrum. This point need not be\\nat the promontory of the sacrum. The obstetric conjugate is divided into 2 segments: (1) the anterior\\nsagittal, originating at the intersection of the obstetric conjugate with the transverse diameter of the\\ninlet and terminating at the symphysis pubica; and (2) the posterior sagittal, originating at the\\ntransverse diameter of the inlet to the point of intersection with the sacrum.\\nInterspinous Diameter\\nA most significant diameter in the midpelvis is the interspinous diameter. It is represented by a plane\\npassing from ischial spine to ischial spine. The posterior sagittal diameter of the midpelvis is a\\nbisecting line drawn at a right angle from the middle of the interspinous diameter, in the same plane,\\nto a point of intersection with the sacrum. This is the point of greatest importance in the midpelvis. It\\nis sometimes said that the posterior sagittal diameter should be drawn from the posterior segment of\\nthe intersecting line of the interspinous diameter, in a plane from the inferior surface of the\\nsymphysis, through the interspinous diameter to the sacrum. However, this configuration often places\\nthe posterior sagittal diameter lower in the pelvis than the interspinous diameter. It is the interspinous\\ndiameter, together with the posterior sagittal diameter of the midpelvis, that determines whether or\\nnot there is adequate room for descent and extension of the head during labor.\\nIntertuberous Diameter\\nThe intertuberous diameter of the outlet will reflect the length of the anterior transverse diameter of\\nthe inlet (ie, the former cannot be larger than the latter if convergent or straight side walls are\\npresent). Therefore, the intertuberous diameter determines the space available in the anterior segment\\nof the pelvis at the inlet, and, similarly, the degree of convergence influences the length of the\\nbiparietal diameter at the outlet.\\nPosterior Sagittal Diameter\\nThe posterior sagittal diameter of the outlet is an intersecting line drawn from the middle of the\\nintertuberous diameter to the sacrococcygeal junction and reflects the inclination of the sacrum\\ntoward the outlet for accommodation of the head at delivery. It should be noted that intricate\\nmeasurements of the pelvis are significant only at minimal levels. Evaluation of the pelvis for a given\\npregnancy, size of the fetus for a given pelvis, and conduct of labor engagement are far more\\nimportant.\\nOutlets of the True Pelvis\\nThe true pelvis is said to have an upper “inlet” and a lower “outlet.” The pelvic inlet to the pelvis\\nminor is bounded, beginning posteriorly, by (1) the promontory of the sacrum; (2) the linea terminalis,\\ncomposed of the anterior margin of the ala sacralis, the arcuate line of the ilium, and the pecten ossis\\npubis; and (3) the upper border or crest of the pubis, ending medially at the symphysis.

These layers, from the most superficial inward, are (1) the\\nskin, (2) the tela subcutanea (subcutaneous tissue), (3) the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle,\\n(4) the internal oblique muscle, (5) the transversus abdominis muscle (below the free border, the layer\\nis incomplete), (6) the transversalis fascia, (7) the subperitoneal fat and connective tissue, and (8) the\\nperitoneum. The tela subcutanea consists of the superficial fatty Camper’s fascia, which is continuous\\nwith the tela subcutanea of the whole body, and the deeper membranous Scarpa’s fascia, which covers\\nthe lower third of the abdominal wall and the medial side of the groin, both joining below the inguinal\\nligament to form the fascia lata of the thigh.\\nSubcutaneous (External) Inguinal Ring\\nA triangular evagination of the external oblique aponeurosis, the subcutaneous inguinal ring (external\\nabdominal ring), is bounded by an aponeurosis at its edges and by the inguinal ligament inferiorly.\\nThe superior or medial crus is smaller and attaches to the symphysis pubica. The inferior or lateral\\ncrus is stronger and blends with the inguinal ligament as it passes to the pubic tubercle. The sharp\\nmargins of the ring are attributed to a sudden thinning of the aponeurosis. In the female, the\\nligamentum teres uteri (round ligament) pass through this ring. The subcutaneous inguinal ring is\\nmuch \\nsmaller in the female than in the male, and the abdominal wall is relatively stronger in this\\nregion.\\nAbdominal (Internal) Inguinal Ring\\nThe abdominal inguinal ring (internal abdominal ring) is the rounded mouth of a funnel-shaped\\nexpansion of transversalis fascia that lies approximately 2 cm above the inguinal ligament and\\nmidway between the anterior superior iliac spine and the symphysis pubica. Medially, it is bounded by\\nthe inferior epigastric vessels; the external iliac artery is situated below.

Instead of descending, as does the testis, the ovary\\nmoves medially, where it becomes adjacent to the uterus.\\nThe intraabdominal portion of the gubernaculum ovarii becomes attached to the lateral border of\\nthe developing uterus, evolving as the ligament of the ovary and the round ligament of the uterus.

The canal is roughly triangular in shape, and its boundaries are largely artificial. The\\nlacunar and inguinal ligaments form the base of the canal. The anterior or superficial wall is formed\\nby the external oblique aponeurosis, and the lowermost fibers of the internal oblique muscle add\\nadditional strength in its lateral part.

From the lateral margin of the tendinous insertion of the rectus muscle,\\nupward toward the umbilicus, and over the obliterated artery extends a more accentuated fold, the\\nplica umbilicalis lateralis. The fovea inguinalis medialis lies between the plica epigastrica and the\\nplica umbilicalis lateralis, with the bottom of the fossa facing the trigonum inguinale (Hesselbach’s\\ntriangle).

Along its inferior\\nborder, it becomes continuous with the fascia lata of the thigh. From the medial portion of the inguinal\\nligament, a triangular band of fibers attaches separately to the pecten ossis pubis. This band is known\\nas the lacunar (Gimbernat’s) ligament. The reflex inguinal ligament (ligament of Colles or triangular\\nfascia) is represented by a small band of fibers, often poorly developed, and derived from the superior\\ncrus of the subcutaneous inguinal ring and the lower part of the linea alba. These fibers cross to the\\nopposite side to attach to the pecten ossis pubis. The inguinal ligament forms the roof of a large\\nosseoligamentous space leading from the iliac fossa to the thigh.

The sheath is divided into 3 compartments: (1) the lateral\\ncompartment, containing the femoral artery; (2) the intermediate compartment, containing the\\nfemoral vein; and (3) the medial compartment or canal, containing a lymph node (nodi lymphatici\\ninguinales profundi [node of Rosenmüller or Cloquet]) and the lymphatic vessels that drain most of\\nthe leg, groin, and perineum.\\nThe femoral canal also contains areolar tissue, which frequently condenses to form the “femoral\\nseptum.” Because of the greater spread of the pelvis in the female, the muscular and vascular lacunae\\nare relatively large spaces. The upper or abdominal opening of the femoral canal is known as the\\nfemoral ring and is covered by the parietal peritoneum.\\nArteries\\nIn front of the femoral ring, the arterial branches of the external iliac artery are the inferior epigastric\\nand the deep circumflex iliac. The inferior epigastric artery arises from the anterior surface of the\\nexternal iliac, passing forward and upward on the anterior abdominal wall between peritoneum and\\ntransversalis fascia. It pierces the fascia just below the arcuate line, entering the rectus abdominis\\nmuscle or coursing along its inferior surface to anastomose with the superior epigastric from the\\ninternal thoracic. The inferior epigastric artery forms the lateral boundary of the trigonum inguinale\\n(Hesselbach’s triangle). At its origin, it frequently gives off a branch to the inguinal canal, as well as a\\nbranch to the pubis (pubic artery), which anastomoses with twigs of the obturator artery. The pubic\\nbranch of the inferior epigastric often becomes the obturator artery.\\nThe deep circumflex iliac artery arises laterally and traverses the iliopsoas to the anterior superior\\niliac spine, where it pierces the transversus muscle to course between the transversus and the internal\\noblique, sending perforators to the surface. It often has anastomoses with penetrating branches of the\\ninferior epigastric via its perforators through the rectus abdominis. The veins follow a similar course.\\nAs the external iliac artery passes through the femoral canal, which underlies the inguinal ligament,\\nit courses medial to the femoral vein and nerve, resting in what is termed the femoral triangle\\n(Scarpa’s triangle). The femoral sheath is a downward continuation of the inguinal ligament anterior\\nto the femoral vessel and nerve.\\nThe branches of the femoral artery supplying the groin are (1) the superficial epigastric, (2) the\\nsuperficial circumflex iliac, (3) the superficial external pudendal, and (4) the deep external pudendal.\\nThe superficial epigastric artery passes upward through the femoral sheath over the inguinal ligament,\\nto rest in Camper’s fascia on the lower abdomen. The superficial circumflex iliac artery arises\\nadjacent to the superior epigastric, piercing the fascia lata and running parallel to the inguinal\\nligament as far as the iliac crest. It then divides into branches that supply the integument of the groin,\\nthe superficial fascia, and the lymph glands, anastomosing with the deep circumflex iliac, the superior\\ngluteal, and the lateral femoral circumflex arteries.\\nThe superficial external pudendal artery arises from the medial side of the femoral artery, close to'),\n",

It pierces the femoral sheath and fascia cribrosa, coursing medially across the\\nround ligament to the integument on the lower part of the abdomen and the labium majus,\\nanastomosing with the internal pudendal. The deep external pudendal artery passes medially across\\nthe pectineus and adductor longus muscles, supplying the integument of the labium majus and\\nforming, together with the external pudendal artery, a rete with the labial arteries.\\nHernias\\nA hernia (\\nFig. 1–14\\n) is a protrusion of any viscus from its normal enclosure, which may occur with\\nany of the abdominal viscera, especially the jejunum, ileum, and greater omentum. A hernia may be\\ndue to increased pressure, such as that resulting from strenuous exercise, lifting heavy weights,\\ntenesmus, or increased expiratory efforts, or it may result from decreased resistance of the abdominal\\nwall (congenital \\nor acquired), such as occurs with debilitating illness or old age, prolonged distention\\nfrom ascites, tumors, pregnancy, corpulence, emaciation, injuries (including surgical incisions),\\ncongenital absence, or poor development. Hernias are likely to occur where the abdominal wall is\\nstructurally weakened by the passage of large vessels or nerves and developmental peculiarities.\\nVentral hernias occur through the linea semilunaris or the linea alba.\\nFigure 1–14\\n. Hernia sites.\\nDuring early fetal development, portions of the mesentery and a loop of the intestine pass through\\nthe opening to occupy a part of the body cavity (the umbilical coelom) situated in the umbilical cord.\\nNormally, the mesentery and intestine later return to the abdominal cavity. If they fail to do so, a\\ncongenital umbilical hernia results. Infantile umbilical hernias occur if the component parts fail to\\nfuse completely in early postnatal stages. The unyielding nature of the fibrous tissue forming the\\nmargin of the ring predisposes to strangulation.'),\n",

The\\nsuperior hypogastric plexus begins just below the inferior mesenteric artery. It is composed of 1–3\\nintercommunicating nerve bundles connected with the inferior mesenteric ganglia, but no ganglia are\\nan integral part of the plexus. The intermesenteric nerves receive branches from the lumbar\\nsympathetic ganglia.\\nSuperior Hypogastric Plexus\\nThe superior hypogastric plexus continues into the mid-hypogastric plexus. The presacral nerves\\nspread out into a latticework at the level of the first sacral vertebra, with connecting rami to the last of\\nthe lumbar ganglia. The greater part of the superior mid-hypogastric plexus may be found to the left of\\nthe midline.\\nInferior Hypogastric Plexus\\nAt the first sacral vertebra, this plexus divides into several branches that go to the right and left sides\\nof the pelvis. These branches form the beginning of the right and left inferior hypogastric plexus. The\\ninferior hypogastric plexus, which is the divided continuation of the mid-hypogastric plexus, the\\nsuperior hypogastric plexus, the presacral nerve, and the uterinus magnus, is composed of several\\nparallel nerves on each side. This group of nerves descends within the pelvis in a position posterior to\\nthe common iliac artery and anterior to the sacral plexus, curves laterally, and finally enters the\\nsacrouterine fold or ligaments. The medial section of the primary division of the sacral nerves sends\\nfibers (nervi erigentes) that enter the pelvic plexus in the sacrouterine folds. The plexus now appears\\nto contain both sympathetic (inferior hypogastric plexus) and parasympathetic (nervi erigentes)\\ncomponents.\\nNervi Erigentes\\nThe sensory components, which are mostly visceral, are found in the nervi erigentes; however, if one\\ntakes into account the amount of spinal anesthetic necessary to eliminate uterine sensation, one must\\nassume that there are a number of sensory fibers in the sympathetic component.\\nCommon Iliac Nerves\\nThe common iliac nerves originate separately from the superior hypogastric plexus and descend on the\\nsurface of the artery and vein, one part going through the femoral ring and the remainder following the\\ninternal iliac, finally rejoining the pelvic plexus.\\nHypogastric Ganglion\\nOn either side of the uterus, in the base of the broad ligament, is the large plexus described by Lee and\\nFrankenhäuser, the so-called hypogastric ganglion. The plexus actually consists of ganglia and nerve\\nramifications of various sizes, as well as branches of the combined inferior hypogastric plexus and the\\nnervi erigentes. It lies parallel to the lateral pelvic wall, its lateral surface superficial to the internal\\niliac and its branches; the ureter occupies a position superficial to the plexus. The middle vesical\\nartery perforates and supplies the plexus, its medial branches supplying the rectal stalk. The greater\\npart of the plexus terminates in large branches that enter the uterus in the region of the internal os,\\nwhile another smaller component of the plexus supplies the vagina and the bladder.

The nerve bundles entering the ganglia contain both\\nmyelinated and unmyelinated elements. Corpuscula lamellosa (Vater-Pacini corpuscles) may be found\\nwithin the tissues and are often observed within nerve bundles, especially within those in the lower\\ndivisions of the plexus. Both myelinated and unmyelinated nerves are present within the uterus. The\\nnerves enter along the blood vessels, the richest supply lying in the isthmic portion of the uterus. The\\nfibers following the blood vessels gradually diminish in number in the direction of the fundus, where\\nthe sparsest distribution occurs. The fibers run parallel to the muscle bundles, and the nerves\\nfrequently branch to form a syncytium before terminating on the sarcoplasm as small free nerve\\nendings.\\nSensory Corpuscles\\nVater-Pacini corpuscles (corpuscula lamellosa) are present outside the uterus. Dogiel and Krause\\ncorpuscles (corpuscula bulboidea) appear in the region of the endocervix. They may also be found in\\nthe broad ligament along with Vater-Pacini corpuscles and at the juncture of the uterine arteries with\\nthe uterus. These corpuscles may act to modulate the stretch response that reflexively stimulates\\nuterine contractions during labor.\\nThe innervation of the cervix shows occasional free endings entering papillae of the stratified\\nsquamous epithelium of the pars vaginalis. The endocervix contains a rich plexus of free endings that\\nis most pronounced in the region of the internal os. The endocervix and the isthmic portion of the\\nuterus in the nonpregnant state both contain the highest number of nerves and blood vessels of any\\npart of the uterus. The presence here of a lamellar type of corpuscle has already been noted.\\nNerves pass through the myometrium and enter the endometrium. A plexus with penetrating fibers\\ninvolving the submucosal region is present in the basal third of the endometrium, with branches\\nterminating in the stroma, in the basilar arterioles, and at the origin of the spiral arterioles. The outer\\ntwo-thirds of the endometrium are devoid of nerves.\\nSTRUCTURES LINING THE PELVIS\\nThe walls of the pelvis minor are made up of the following layers: (1) the peritoneum, (2) the\\nsubperitoneal or extraperitoneal fibroareolar layer, (3) the fascial layer, and (4) the muscular layer.\\nThe anatomy of the floor of the pelvis is comparable to that of the walls except for the absence of an\\nosseoligamentous layer.\\nPeritoneum\\nThe peritoneum presents several distinct transverse folds that form corresponding fossae on each side.\\nThe most anterior is a variable fold, the transverse vesical, extending from the bladder laterally to the\\npelvic wall. It is not the superficial covering of any definitive structure. Behind it lies the broad\\nligament, which partially covers and aids in the support of the uterus and adnexa.\\nLigaments\\nThe broad ligament extends from the lateral border on either side of the uterus to the floor and side\\nwalls of the pelvis.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='and the posterior facing upward, conforming to the position of the uterus. The inferior or “attached”\\nborder of the broad ligament is continuous with the parietal peritoneum on the floor and on the side\\nwalls of the pelvis. Along this border, the posterior layer continues laterally and posteriorly in an arc\\nto the region of the sacrum, forming the uterosacral fold. Another fold—the rectouterine fold—\\nfrequently passes from the posterior surface of the cervix to the rectum in the midline.\\nThe anterior layer of the broad ligament is continuous laterally along the inferior border with the\\nperitoneum of the paravesical fossae and continuous medially with peritoneum on the upper surface of\\nthe bladder. Both layers of the attached border continue up the side walls of the pelvis to join with a\\ntriangular fold of peritoneum, reaching to the brim of the pelvis to form the suspensory ligament of\\nthe ovary or infundibular ligament. This ligament contains the ovarian vessels and nerves. The medial\\nborder of the broad ligament on either side is continuous with the peritoneal covering on both uterine\\nsurfaces. The 2 layers of the ligament separate to partially contain the uterus, and the superior or\\n“free” border, which is laterally continuous with the suspensory ligament of the ovary, envelops the\\nuterine tube.\\nThe broad ligament can be divided into regions as follows: (1) a larger portion, the mesometrium,\\nwhich is associated especially with the lateral border of the uterus; (2) the mesovarium, the fold that\\nsprings from the posterior layer of the ovary; and (3) the thin portion, the mesosalpinx, which is\\nassociated with the fallopian tube in the region of the free border. The superior lateral corner of the\\nbroad ligament has been referred to as the suspensory ligament of the ovary, or infundibulopelvic\\nligament, because it suspends the infundibulum as well as the ovary.\\nFossae & Spaces\\nCorresponding to the peritoneal folds are the peritoneal fossae. The prevesical or retropubic space is a\\npotential space that is crossed by the transverse vesical fold. It is situated in front of the bladder and\\nbehind the pubis. When the bladder is displaced posteriorly, it becomes an actual space, anteriorly\\ncontinuous from side to side and posteriorly limited by a condensation of fatty areolar tissue\\nextending from the base of the bladder to the side wall of the pelvis.\\nThe vesicouterine pouch is a narrow cul-de-sac between the anterior surface of the body of the\\nuterus and the upper surface of the bladder when the uterus is in normal ante-flexed position. In the\\nbottom of this pouch, the peritoneum is reflected from the bladder onto the uterus at the junction of\\nthe cervix and corpus. Therefore, the anterior surface of the cervix is below the level of the\\nperitoneum and is connected with the base of the bladder by condensed areolar tissue.\\nThe peritoneum on the posterior surface of the body of the uterus extends downward onto the\\ncervix and onto the posterior fornix of the vagina. It is then reflected onto the anterior surface of the\\nrectum to form a narrow cul-de-sac continuous with the pararectal fossa of either side. The entire\\nspace, bounded anteriorly by the cervix and by the fornix in the midline, the uterosacral folds\\nlaterally, and the rectum posteriorly, is the rectouterine pouch or cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas).\\nSubperitoneal & Fascial Layers\\nThe subperitoneal layer consists of loose, fatty areolar tissue underlying the peritoneum. External to\\nthe subperitoneal layer, a layer of fascia lines the wall of the pelvis, covering the muscles and, where\\nthese are lacking, blending with the periosteum of the pelvic bones. This layer is known as the parietal\\npelvic fascia and is subdivided into the obturator fascia, the fascia of the urogenital diaphragm, and\\nthe fascia of the piriformis.\\nThe obturator fascia is of considerable thickness and covers the obturator internus muscle.

In this lower\\nregion, it also becomes continuous with a double-layered triangular sheet of fascia, the fasciae of the\\nurogenital diaphragm, passing across the anterior part of the pelvic outlet. A much thinner portion of\\nthe parietal pelvic fascia covers the piriformis and coccygeus muscles in the posterior pelvic wall.\\nMedially, the piriformis fascia blends with the periosteum of the sacrum around the margins of the\\nanterior sacral foramens and covers the roots and first branches of the sacral plexus.\\nVisceral pelvic fascia denotes the fascia in the bottom of the pelvic bowl, which invests the pelvic\\norgans and forms a number of supports that suspend the organs from the pelvic walls. These supports\\narise in common from the obturator part of the parietal fascia, along or near the arcus tendineus. This\\narc or line extends from a point near the lower part of the symphysis pubica to the root of the spine of\\nthe ischium. From this common origin, the fascia spreads inward and backward, dividing into a\\nnumber of parts classified as either investing (endopelvic) fascia or suspensory and diaphragmatic\\nfascia.\\nMuscular Layer\\nThe muscles of the greater pelvis are the psoas major and iliacus. Those of the lesser pelvis are the\\npiriformis, obturator internus, coccygeus, and levator ani; they do not form a continuous layer.\\nGreater Pelvis\\nPsoas Major\\nThe fusiform psoas major muscle originates from the 12th thoracic to the fifth lumbar vertebrae.\\nParallel fiber bundles descend nearly vertically along the side of the vertebral bodies and extend along\\nthe border of the minor pelvis, beneath the inguinal ligament, and on toward insertion in the thigh. The\\nmedial border inserts into the lesser trochanter, whereas the lateral border shares its tendon with the\\niliacus muscle. Together with the iliacus, it is the most powerful flexor of the thigh, acting as a lateral\\nrotator of the femur when the foot is off the ground and free and as a medial rotator when the foot is\\non the ground and the tibia is fixed. The psoas component flexes the spine and the pelvis and abducts\\nthe lumbar region of the spine. The psoas, having longer fibers than the iliacus, gives a quicker but\\nweaker pull.\\nIliacus\\nThe fan-shaped iliacus muscle originates from the iliac crest, the iliolumbar ligament, the greater part\\nof the iliac fossa, the anterior sacroiliac ligaments, and frequently the ala of the sacrum. It also\\noriginates from the ventral border of the ilium between the 2 anterior spines. It is inserted in an\\noblique manner on the lateral surface of the tendon that emerges from the psoas above the inguinal\\nligament and directly on the femur immediately distal to the lesser trochanter. The lateral portion of\\nthe muscle arising from the ventral border of the ilium is adherent to the direct tendon of the rectus\\nfemoris and the capsule of the hip joint.\\nLesser Pelvis\\nPiriformis\\nThe piriformis has its origin from the lateral part of the ventral surface of the second, third, and fourth'),\n",

A large part of the muscle is aponeurotic.\\nIt supports the pelvic and abdominal viscera and possibly flexes and abducts the coccyx.\\nLevator Ani\\nThe levator ani muscle forms the floor of the pelvis and the roof of the perineum. It is divisible into 3\\nportions: (1) the iliococcygeus, (2) the pubococcygeus, and (3) the puborectalis.\\n1. Iliococcygeus—The iliococcygeus arises from the arcus tendineus, which extends from the ischial\\nspine to the superior ramus of the pubis near the obturator canal and for a variable distance downward\\nbelow the obturator canal. Its insertion is into the lateral aspect of the coccyx and the raphe that\\nextends from the tip of the coccyx to the rectum. Many fiber bundles cross the median line.\\n2. Pubococcygeus—The pubococcygeus arises from the inner surface of the os pubis, the lower margin\\nof the symphysis pubica to the obturator canal, and the arcus tendineus as far backward as the origin\\nof the iliococcygeus. It passes backward, downward, and medially past the urogenital organs and the\\nrectum, inserting into the anterior sacrococcygeal ligament, the deep part of the anococcygeal raphe,\\nand each side of the rectum. The pubococcygeus lies to some extent on the pelvic surface of the\\ninsertion of the iliococcygeus.\\n3. Puborectalis—The puborectalis arises from the body and descending ramus of the pubis beneath the\\norigin of the pubococcygeus, the neighboring part of the obturator fascia, and the fascia covering the\\npelvic surface of the urogenital diaphragm. Many of the fiber bundles interdigitate with those of the\\nopposite side, and they form a thick band on each side of the rectum behind which those of each side\\nare inserted into the anococcygeal raphe.\\nThe levator ani serves to slightly flex the coccyx, raise the anus, and constrict the rectum and\\nvagina. It resists the downward pressure that the thoracoabdominal diaphragm exerts on the viscera\\nduring inspiration.\\nPelvic Diaphragm\\nThe pelvic diaphragm (\\nFig. 1–15\\n) extends from the upper part of the pelvic surface of the pubis and\\nischium to the rectum, which passes through it.

The iliac\\nsupplies both the iliacus and psoas muscles. It passes laterally beneath the psoas and the femoral nerve\\nand, perforating the iliacus, ramifies in the iliac fossa between the muscle and the bone. It supplies a\\nnutrient artery to the bone and then divides into several branches that can be traced as follows: (1)\\nupward toward the sacroiliac synchondrosis to anastomose with the last lumbar artery, (2) laterally\\ntoward the crest of the ilium to anastomose with the lateral circumflex and gluteal arteries, and (3)\\nmedially toward the pelvis minor to anastomose with the deep circumflex iliac from the external iliac.\\nThe lumbar branch ascends beneath the psoas and supplies that muscle along with the quadratus\\nlumborum. It then anastomoses with the last lumbar artery.\\nAnother branch of the hypogastric artery, the lateral sacral artery, may be represented as 2 distinct\\nvessels. It passes medially in front of the sacrum and turns downward to run parallel with the\\nsympathetic trunk. Crossing the slips of origin of the piriformis muscle, it sends branches to that\\nmuscle.

The obturator artery usually arises from the\\nhypogastric, but occasionally it may stem from the inferior epigastric or directly from the external\\niliac artery. It runs forward and downward slightly below the brim of the pelvis, lying between the\\nperitoneum and endopelvic fascia. Passing through the obturator canal, it emerges and divides into\\nanterior and posterior branches that curve around the margin of the obturator foramen beneath the\\nobturator externus muscle.\\nWhen the obturator artery arises from the inferior epigastric or external iliac artery, its proximal\\nrelationships are profoundly altered, the vessel coursing near the femoral ring where it may be\\nendangered during operative procedures.

The deep circumflex iliac\\nartery arises from the side of the external iliac artery either opposite the epigastric or a little below the\\norigin of that vessel.

They form the lateral boundaries of the vulva and are approximately 7–9\\ncm long and 2–4 cm wide, varying in \\nsize with height, weight, race, age, parity, and pelvic\\narchitecture. Embryologically, these permanent folds of skin are homologous to the scrotum of the\\nmale. Hair is distributed over their surfaces, extending superiorly in the area of the mons pubis from\\none side to the other. The lateral surfaces are adjacent to the medial surface of the thigh, forming a\\ndeep groove when the legs are together. The medial surfaces of the labia majora may oppose each\\nother directly or may be separated by protrusion of the labia minora. The cleft that is formed by this\\nopposition anteriorly is termed the anterior commissure. Posteriorly, the cleft is less clearly defined\\nand termed the posterior commissure. The middle portion of the cleft between the 2 labia is the rima\\npudendi.\\nDeep Structures\\nUnderlying the skin is a thin, poorly developed muscle layer called the tunica dartos labialis, the\\nfibers of which course, for the most part, at right angles to the wrinkles of the surface, forming a\\ncrisscross pattern. Deep to the dartos layer is a thin layer of fascia, most readily recognizable in the\\nold or the young because of the large amount of adipose and areolar tissue. Numerous sweat glands are\\nfound in the labia majora, with the greater number on the medial aspect. In the deeper substance of the\\nlabia majora are longitudinal bands of muscle that are continuous with the ligamentum teres uteri\\n(round ligament) as it emerges from the inguinal canal. Occasionally, a persistent processus vaginalis\\nperitonei (canal of Nuck) may be seen in the upper region of the labia. This can occasionally fill with\\nfluid causing a cyst in the canal of Nuck to be present in the labia majora. Complete surgical\\nobliteration of this persistent tract will solve this problem.\\nArteries\\nThe arterial supply into the labia majora comes from the internal and external pudendals, with\\nextensive anastomoses. Within the labia majora is a circular arterial pattern originating inferiorly\\nfrom a branch of the perineal artery, from the external pudendal artery in the anterior lateral aspect,\\nand from a small artery of the ligamentum teres uteri superiorly. The inferior branch from the perineal\\nartery, which originates from the internal pudendal as it emerges from the canalis pudendalis\\n(Alcock’s canal), forms the base of the rete with the external pudendal arteries. These arise from the\\nmedial side of the femoral and, occasionally, from the deep arteries just beneath the femoral ring,\\ncoursing medially over the pectineus and adductor muscles, to which they supply branches. They\\nterminate in a circular rete within the labium majus, penetrating the fascia lata adjacent to the fossa\\novalis and passing over the round ligament to send a branch to the clitoris.\\nVeins\\nThe venous drainage is extensive and forms a plexus with numerous anastomoses. In addition, the\\nveins communicate with the dorsal vein of the clitoris, the veins of the labia \\nminora, and the perineal\\nveins, as well as with the inferior hemorrhoidal plexus.

These nodes drain into the superficial inguinal nodes overlying the\\nsaphenous fossa.

This drainage may include afferent\\nlymphatics from the perineum. In the region of the symphysis pubica, the lymphatics anastomose in a\\nplexus between the right and left nodes. Therefore, any lesion involving the labia majora allows direct\\ninvolvement of the lymphatic structures of the contralateral inguinal area. The lower part of the\\nlabium majus has superficial and deep drainage that is shared with the perineal area. The drainage\\npasses, in part, through afferent lymphatics to superficial subinguinal nodes; from the posterior\\nmedial aspects of the labia majora, it frequently enters the lymphatic plexus surrounding the rectum.\\nNerves\\nThe innervation of the external genitalia has been studied by many investigators. The iliohypogastric\\nnerve originates from T12 and L1 and traverses laterally to the iliac crest between the transversus and\\ninternal oblique muscles, at which point it divides into 2 branches: (1) the anterior hypogastric nerve,\\nwhich descends anteriorly through the skin over the symphysis, supplying the superior portion of the\\nlabia majora and the mons pubis; and (2) the posterior iliac, which passes to the gluteal area.\\nThe ilioinguinal nerve originates from L1 and follows a course slightly inferior to the\\niliohypogastric nerve, with which it may frequently anastomose, branching into many small fibers that\\nterminate in the upper medial aspect of the labium majus.\\nThe genitofemoral nerve (L1–L2) emerges from the anterior surface of the psoas muscle to run\\nobliquely downward over its surface, branching in the deeper substance of the labium majus to supply\\nthe dartos muscle and that vestige of the cremaster present within the labium majus.

A total absence of endings within the clitoris itself takes on clinical significance when one\\nconsiders the emphasis placed on the clitoris in discussing problems of sexual gratification in women.\\nVestibule\\nSuperficial Anatomy\\nThe area of the vestibule is bordered by the labia minora laterally, by the frenulum labiorum pudendi\\n(or posterior commissure) posteriorly, and by the urethra and clitoris anteriorly. Inferiorly, it is\\nbordered by the hymenal ring. The opening of the vagina or junction of the vagina with the vestibule is\\nlimited by a membrane stretching from the posterior and lateral sides to the inferior surface of the\\nexternal urethral orifice. This membrane is termed the hymen. Its shape and openings vary and depend\\non age, parity, and sexual experience. The form of the opening may be infantile, annular, semilunar,\\ncribriform, septate, or vertical; the hymen may even be imperforate. In parous women and in the\\npostcoital state, the tags of the hymenal integument are termed carunculae myrtiformes.\\nThe external urethral orifice, which is approximately 2–3 cm posterior to the clitoris, on a slightly\\nelevated and irregular surface with depressed areas on the sides, may appear to be stellate or\\ncrescentic in shape. It is characterized by many small mucosal folds around its opening.

The epithelium of the duct is simple in\\ntype, and its orifice is stratified squamous like the vestibule. The secretion is a clear, viscid, and\\nstringy mucoid substance with an alkaline pH.

Its form, size, and position vary with the amount of\\nurine it contains. When empty, it takes the form of a somewhat rounded pyramid, having a base, a\\nvertex (or apex), a superior surface, and a convex inferior surface that may be divided by a median\\nridge into 2 inferolateral surfaces.\\nRelationships\\nThe superior surface of the bladder is covered with peritoneum that is continuous with the medial\\numbilical fold, forming the paravesical fossae laterally. Posteriorly, the peritoneum passes onto the\\nuterus at the junction of the cervix and corpus, continuing upward on the anterior surface to form the\\nvesicouterine pouch. When the bladder is empty, the normal uterus rests upon its superior surface.\\nWhen the bladder is distended, coils of intestine may lie upon its superior surface. The base of the\\nbladder rests below the peritoneum and is adjacent to the cervix and the anterior fornix of the vagina.\\nIt is separated from these structures by areolar tissue containing plexiform veins. The area over the\\nvagina is extended as the bladder fills. The inferolateral surfaces are separated from the wall of the\\npelvis by the potential prevesical space, containing a small amount of areolar tissue but no large\\nvessels. This surface is nonperitoneal and thus suitable for operative procedures. Posterolateral to the\\nregion facing the symphysis, each of the inferolateral surfaces is in relation to the fascia of the\\nobturator internus, the obturator vessels and nerve, the obliterated umbilical artery above, and the\\nfascia of the levator ani below. Posteriorly and medially, the inferior surface is separated from the\\nbase by an area called the urethrovesical junction, the most stationary portion of the bladder.\\nFascia, Ligaments, & Muscle'),\n",

Two thickenings of the endopelvic\\nfascia, the medial and lateral pubovesical or puboprostatic ligaments, extend at the vesicourethral\\njunction abutting the levator ani muscle from the lower part of the anterior aspect of the bladder to the\\npubic bones. Similar fascial thickenings, the lateral true ligaments, extend from the sides of the lower\\npart of the bladder to the lateral walls of the pelvis. Posteriorly, the vesicourethral junction of the\\nbladder lies directly against the anterior wall of the vagina.\\nA fibrous band, the urachus or medial umbilical ligament, extends from the apex of the bladder to\\nthe umbilicus. This band represents the remains of the embryonic allantois. The lateral umbilical\\nligaments are formed by the obliterated umbilical arteries and are represented by fibrous cords\\npassing along the sides of the bladder and ascending toward the umbilicus. Frequently, the vessels will\\nbe patent, thus forming the superior vesical arteries. The peritoneal covering of the bladder is limited\\nto the upper surface. The reflections of the peritoneum to the anterior abdominal wall and the\\ncorresponding walls of the pelvis are sometimes described as the superior, lateral, and posterior false\\nligaments. The muscle (smooth) of the bladder is represented by an interdigitated pattern continuous\\nwith and contiguous to the inner longitudinal and anterior circumferential muscles of the urethra. No\\ndistinct muscle layers are apparent.\\nMucous Membrane\\nThe mucous membrane is rose-colored and lies in irregular folds that become effaced by distention.\\nThe 3 angles of the vesical trigone are represented by the orifices of the 2 ureters \\nand the internal\\nurethral orifice. This area is redder in color and free from plication. It is bordered posteriorly by the\\nplica interureterica, a curved transverse ridge extending between the orifices of the ureters. A median\\nlongitudinal elevation, the uvula vesicae, extends toward the urethral orifice. The internal urethral\\norifice is normally situated at the lowest point of the bladder, at the junction of the inferolateral and\\nposterior surfaces. It is surrounded by a circular elevation, the urethral annulus, approximately level\\nwith the center of the symphysis pubica. The epithelial lining of the bladder is transitional in type. The\\nmucous membrane rests on the submucous coat, composed of areolar tissue superficial to the\\nmuscular coat. There is no evidence of a specific smooth muscle sphincter in the vesical neck.\\nArteries, Veins, & Lymphatics\\nThe blood supply to the bladder comes from branches of the hypogastric artery. The umbilical artery,\\na terminal branch of the hypogastric artery, gives off the superior vesical artery prior to its obliterated\\nportion. It approaches the bladder (along with the middle and inferior vesical arteries) through a\\ncondensation of fatty areolar tissue, limiting the prevesical “space” posterosuperiorly, to branch out\\nover the upper surface of the bladder. It anastomoses with the arteries of the opposite side and the\\nmiddle and inferior vesical arteries below. The middle vesical artery may arise from one of the\\nsuperior vessels, or it may come from the umbilical artery, supplying the sides and base of the\\nbladder. The inferior vesical artery usually arises directly from the hypogastric artery—in common\\nwith or as a branch of the uterine artery—and passes downward and medially, where it divides into\\nbranches that supply the lower part of the bladder. The fundus may also receive small branches from\\nthe middle hemorrhoidal, uterine, and vaginal arteries. The veins form an extensive plexus at the sides\\nand base of the bladder from which stems pass to the hypogastric trunk.\\nThe lymphatics, in part, accompany the veins and communicate with the hypogastric nodes. They\\nalso communicate laterally with the external iliac glands, and some of those from the fundus pass to\\nnodes situated at the promontory of the sacrum.

It is partly abdominal and partly pelvic\\nand lies entirely behind the peritoneum. Its diameter varies from 4–6 mm, depending on distention,\\nand its size is uniform except for 3 slightly constricted portions.\\nThe first of 3 constrictions is found at the junction of the ureter with the renal pelvis and is known\\nas the upper isthmus. The second constriction—the lower isthmus—is at the point where the ureter\\ncrosses the brim of the pelvis minor. The third (intramural) constriction is at the terminal part of the\\nureter as it passes through the bladder wall.\\nThe pelvic portion of the ureter begins as the ureter crosses the pelvic brim beneath the ovarian\\nvessels and near the bifurcation of the common iliac artery. It conforms to the curvature of the lateral\\npelvic wall, inclining slightly laterally and posteriorly until it reaches the pelvic floor. The ureter then\\nbends anteriorly and medially at about the level of the ischial spine to reach the bladder. In its upper\\nportion, it is related posteriorly to the sacroiliac articulation; then, lying upon the obturator internus\\nmuscle and fascia, it crosses the root of the umbilical artery, the obturator vessels, and the obturator\\nnerve.\\nIn its anterior relationship, the ureter emerges from behind the ovary and under its vessels to pass\\nbehind the uterine and superior and middle vesical arteries. Coursing anteriorly, it comes into close\\nrelation with the lateral fornix of the vagina, passing 8–12 mm from the cervix and vaginal wall\\nbefore reaching the bladder. When the ureters reach the bladder, they are about 5 cm apart. The ureters\\nopen into the bladder by 2 slitlike apertures, the urethral orifices, about 2.5 cm apart when the bladder\\nis empty.\\nWall of Ureter\\nThe wall of the ureter is approximately 3 mm thick and is composed of 3 coats: connective tissue,\\nmuscle, and mucous membrane. The muscular coat has an external circular and an internal\\nlongitudinal layer throughout its course and an external longitudinal layer in its lower third. The\\nmucous membrane is longitudinally plicated and covered by transitional epithelium. The intermittent\\nperistaltic action of the ureteral musculature propels urine into the bladder in jets. The oblique\\npassage of the ureter through the bladder wall tends to constitute a valvular arrangement, but no true\\nvalve is present. The circular fibers of the intramural portion of the ureter possess a sphincter like\\naction. Still, under some conditions of overdistention of the bladder, urine may be forced back into the\\nureter.\\nArteries, Veins, & Lymphatics\\nThe pelvic portion of the ureter receives its blood supply from a direct branch of the hypogastric\\nartery, anastomosing superiorly in its adventitia with branches from the iliolumbar and inferiorly with'),\n",

The middle segment appears to receive\\npostganglions of sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers through and from the middle hypogastric\\nplexus. The upper third is supplied by the same innervation as the kidney.\\nUrethra\\nAnatomy & Relationships\\nThe female urethra is a canal 2.5–4 cm long. It extends downward and forward in a curve from the\\nneck of the bladder (internal urethral orifice), which lies nearly opposite the symphysis pubica. Its\\ntermination, the external urethral orifice, is situated inferiorly and posteriorly from the lower border\\nof the symphysis. Posteriorly, it is closely applied to the anterior wall of the vagina, especially in the\\nlower two-thirds, where it actually is integrated with the wall, forming the urethral carina. Anteriorly,\\nthe upper end is separated from the prevesical “space” by the pubovesical (puboprostatic) ligaments,\\nabutting against the levator ani and vagina and extending upward onto the pubic rami.\\nAnatomy of Walls\\nThe walls of the urethra are very distensible, composed of spongy fibromuscular tissue containing\\ncavernous veins and lined by submucous and mucous coats. The mucosa contains numerous\\nlongitudinal lines when undistended, the most prominent of which is located on the posterior wall and\\ntermed the crista urethralis. Also, there are numerous small glands (the homologue of the male\\nprostate, paraurethral and periurethral glands of Astruc, ducts of Skene) that open into the urethra. The\\nlargest of these, the paraurethral glands of Skene, may open via a pair of ducts beside the external\\nurethral orifice in the vestibule. The epithelium begins as transitional at the upper end and becomes\\nsquamous in the lower part.\\nExternal to the urethral lumen is a smooth muscle coat composed of an outer circular layer and an\\ninner longitudinal layer in the lower two-thirds. In the upper third, the muscle bundles of the layers\\ninterdigitate in a basketlike weave to become continuous with and contiguous to those of the bladder.\\nThe entire urethral circular smooth muscle acts as the involuntary sphincter. In the region of the\\njuncture of the middle and lower thirds of the urethra, decussating fibers (striated in type) form the\\nmiddle heads of the bulbocavernosus and ischiocavernosus muscles and encircle the urethra to form\\nthe sphincter urethrae (voluntary sphincter).\\nArteries & Veins\\nThe arterial supply is intimately involved with that of the anterior vaginal wall, with cruciate\\nanastomoses to the bladder. On each side of the vagina are the vaginal arteries, originating in part\\nfrom the coronary artery of the cervix, the inferior vesical artery, or a direct branch of the uterine'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='artery. In the midline of the anterior vaginal wall is the azygos artery, originating from the coronary or\\ncircular artery of the cervix. Approximately 5 branches traverse the anterior vaginal wall from the\\nlateral vaginal arteries to the azygos in the midline, with small sprigs supplying the urethra. A rich\\nanastomosis with the introitus involves the clitoral artery (urethral branches) as the artery divides into\\nthe dorsal and superficial arteries of the clitoris, a terminal branch of the internal pudendal artery. The\\nvenous drainage follows the arterial pattern, although it is less well defined. In the upper portion of\\nthe vagina, it forms an extensive network called the plexus of Santorini.\\nNerves\\nThe nerve supply is parasympathetic, sympathetic, and spinal. The parasympathetic and sympathetic\\nnerves are derived from the hypogastric plexus; the spinal supply is via the pudendal nerve.\\nUterus\\nAnatomy\\nThe uterus is a pear-shaped, thick-walled, muscular organ, situated between the base of the bladder\\nand the rectum. Covered on each side by the 2 layers of the broad ligament, it communicates above\\nwith the uterine tubes and below with the vagina. It is divided into 2 main portions, the larger portion\\nor body above and the smaller cervix below, connected by a transverse constriction, the isthmus. The\\nbody is flattened so that the side-to-side dimension is greater than the anteroposterior dimension and\\nlarger in women who have borne children. The anterior or vesical surface is almost flat; the posterior\\nsurface is convex. The fallopian tubes join the uterus at the superior (lateral) angles. The round\\nportion that extends above the plane passing through the points of attachment of the 2 tubes is termed\\nthe fundus. This portion is the region of greatest breadth.\\nThe cavity of the body, when viewed from the front or back, is roughly triangular with the base up.\\nThe communication of the cavity below with the cavity of the cervix corresponds in position to the\\nisthmus and forms the \\ninternal orifice (internal os uteri). The cervix, also called the portio vaginalis,\\nis somewhat barrel-shaped and is 2–4 cm in length, its lower end joining the vagina at an angle\\nvarying from 45–90 degrees. It projects into the vagina and is divided into a supravaginal and a\\nvaginal portion by the line of attachment. About one fourth of the anterior surface and half of the\\nposterior surface of the cervix belong to the vaginal portion. At the extremity of the vaginal portion is\\nthe opening leading to the vagina, the external orifice (external os uteri), which is round or oval before\\nparturition but takes the form of a transverse slit in women who have borne children. The cavity of the\\ncervix is fusiform in shape, with longitudinal folds or furrows, and extends from the internal to the\\nexternal orifice. The endocervical canal is composed of columnar, mucus-secreting cells, whereas the\\nexternal cervix is lined by nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium. The junction between these 2 areas\\nis called the squamocolumnar junction or transitional zone.\\nThe size of the uterus varies, under normal conditions, at different ages and in different physiologic\\nstates. In the adult woman who has never borne children, it is approximately 7–8 cm long, 4–5 cm at\\nits widest point, and 30–40 g in weight. In the prepubertal period, it is considerably smaller. In women\\nwho have borne children, it is larger. Its shape, size, and characteristics in the pregnant state become\\nconsiderably modified depending on the stage of gestation.\\nLayers of Uterine Wall\\nThe wall of the uterus is very thick and consists of 3 layers: serous, muscular, and mucous. The serous'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='layer (perimetrium) is simply the peritoneal covering. It is thin and firmly adherent over the fundus\\nand most of the body, and then thickens posteriorly and becomes separated from the muscle by the\\nparametrium. The muscular layer (myometrium) is extremely thick at about 1.5–2.5 cm and\\ncontinuous with that of the tubes and vagina. It also extends into the ovarian and round ligaments, into\\nthe cardinal ligaments at the cervix, and minimally into the uterosacral ligaments. Two principal\\nlayers of the muscular coat can be distinguished: (1) the outer layer, which is weaker and composed of\\nlongitudinal fibers; and (2) a stronger inner layer, the fibers of which are interlaced and run in various\\ndirections, having intermingled within them large venous plexuses. The muscle layer hypertrophies\\nwith the internal os to form a sphincter.\\nThe cervix, from the internal os distally, progressively loses its smooth muscle, finally to be\\nentirely devoid of smooth muscle and elastic in its distal half. It is, in fact, the “dead-end tendon” of\\nthe uterus, at which point, during the active component of labor, both the uterus and the vagina direct\\ntheir efforts. The mucous layer (endometrium) is soft and spongy, composed of tissue resembling\\nembryonic connective tissue. The surface consists of a single layer of ciliated columnar epithelium.\\nThe tissue is rather delicate and friable and contains many tubular glands that open into the cavity of\\nthe uterus.\\nPosition & Axis Direction\\nThe direction of the axis of the uterus varies greatly. Normally, the uterus forms a sharp angle with the\\nvagina so that its anterior surface lies on the upper surface of the bladder and the body is in a\\nhorizontal plane when the woman is standing erect. There is a bend in the area of the isthmus, at which\\nthe cervix then faces downward. This position is the normal anteversion or angulation of the uterus,\\nalthough it may be placed backward (retroversion), without angulation (military position), or to one\\nside (lateral version). The forward flexion at the isthmus is referred to as anteflexion, or there may be\\na corresponding retroflexion or lateral flexion. There is no sharp line between the normal and\\npathologic state of anterior angulation.\\nRelationships\\nAnteriorly, the body of the uterus rests upon the upper and posterior surfaces of the bladder, separated\\nby the uterovesical pouch of the peritoneum. The whole of the anterior wall of the cervix is below the\\nfloor of this pouch, and it is separated from the base of the bladder only by connective tissue.\\nPosteriorly, the peritoneal covering extends down as far as the uppermost portion of the vagina;\\ntherefore, the entire posterior surface of the uterus is covered by peritoneum, and the convex posterior\\nwall is separated from the rectum by the rectouterine pouch (cul-de-sac or pouch of Douglas). Coils of\\nintestine may rest upon the posterior surface of the body of the uterus and may be present in the\\nrectouterine pouch.\\nLaterally, the uterus is related to the various structures contained within the broad ligament: the\\nuterine tubes, the round ligament and the ligament of the ovary, the uterine artery and veins, and the\\nureter. The relationships of the ureters and the uterine arteries are very important surgically. The\\nureters, as they pass to the bladder, run parallel with the cervix for a distance of 8–12 mm. The uterine\\nartery crosses the ureter anterosuperiorly near the cervix, about 1.5 cm from the lateral fornix of the\\nvagina. In effect, the ureter passes under the uterine artery “as water flows under a bridge.”\\nLigaments\\nAlthough the cervix of the uterus is fixed, the body is free to rise and fall with the filling and\\nemptying of the bladder.

There is a natural defect in the muscle\\nat its sides (hilum of the uterus) and at the cervical isthmus (internal os), where the vasculature and\\nnerve supply enter the uterus.\\nThe round ligaments of the uterus, although forming no real support, may assist in maintaining the\\nbody of the uterus in its typical position over the bladder. They consist of fibrous cords containing\\nsmooth muscle (longitudinal) from the outer layer of the corpus. From a point of attachment to the\\nuterus immediately below that of the ovarian ligament, each round ligament extends downward,\\nlaterally, and forward between the 2 layers of the mesometrium, toward the abdominal inguinal ring\\nthat it traverses and the inguinal canal, to terminate in a fanlike manner in the labia majora and\\nbecome continuous with connective tissue. The round ligament is the gubernaculum (ligamentum\\nteres uteri), vestigial in the female. It is accompanied by a funicular branch of the ovarian artery, by a\\nbranch from the ovarian venous plexus, and, in the lower part of its course, by a branch from the\\ninferior epigastric artery (Sampson’s artery), over which it passes as it enters the inguinal ring.\\nThrough the inguinal canal, it is accompanied by the ilioinguinal nerve and the external spermatic\\nbranch of the genitofemoral nerve.\\nThe broad ligament, consisting of a transverse fold of peritoneum that arises from the floor of the\\npelvis between the rectum and the bladder, provides minimal support. In addition to the static support\\nof these ligaments, the pelvic diaphragm (levator ani) provides an indirect and dynamic support.\\nThese muscles do not actually come in contact with the uterus, but they aid in supporting the vagina\\nand maintain the entire pelvic floor in resisting downward pressure. The effectiveness of these\\nmuscles depends on an intact perineum (perineal body, bulbocavernosus muscle and body), for if it is\\nlacerated or weakened the ligaments will gradually stretch and the uterus will descend. The uterus and\\nits components and the vagina are, in fact, one continuous unit.\\nArteries\\nThe blood supply to the uterus is from the uterine and ovarian arteries.

There are\\nconnections with the ovarian veins and the inferior epigastric by way of the vein accompanying the\\nround ligament.\\nLymphatics\\nLymphatic drainage involves several chains of lymph nodes. From the subperitoneal plexus, the\\ncollecting trunks of the lower uterine segment may drain by way of the cervix to the external iliac\\nchain or by way of the isthmus to the lateral sacral nodes. Drainage along the round ligament\\nprogresses to the superficial inguinal nodes, then to the femoral, and finally to the external iliac chain.\\nDrainage laterally to the suspensory ligament of the ovary involves the lumbar pedicle and progresses\\nin a retroperitoneal manner across and anteriorly to the ureter, to the lumbar nodes (interaorticocaval)\\nthat lie along the aorta, and inferiorly to the kidney.\\nFallopian Tubes (Uterine Oviducts\\n)\\nAnatomy\\nThe fallopian tubes serve to convey the ova (eggs) to the uterus. They extend from the superior angles\\nof the uterus \\nto the region of the ovaries, running in the superior border of the broad ligament\\n(mesosalpinx). The fallopian tubes and ovaries are collectively referred to as the adnexa. The course\\nof each tube is nearly horizontal at first and slightly backward.

The interstitial is the portion of the tube that lies within the uterine wall. The\\ninnermost portion is seen from the uterine cavity as the tubal ostea.\\nLayers of Wall\\nThe wall of the tube has 4 coats: serous (peritoneal), subserous or adventitial (fibrous and vascular),\\nmuscular, and mucous. Each tube is enclosed within a peritoneal covering except along a small strip\\non its lower surface, where the mesosalpinx is attached. At the margins of the infundibulum and the\\nfimbriae, this peritoneal covering becomes directly continuous with the mucous membrane lining the\\ninterior of the tube. The subserous tissue is lax in the immediate vicinity of the tube. The blood and\\nnerve supply is found within this layer. The muscular coat has an outer longitudinal and an inner\\ncircular layer of smooth muscle fibers, more prominent and continuous with that of the uterus at the\\nuterine end of the tube. The mucous coat is ciliated columnar epithelium with coarse longitudinal\\nfolds, simple in the region of the isthmus but becoming higher and more complex in the ampulla. The\\nepithelial lining extends outward into the fimbriae. The ciliary motion is directed toward the uterus.\\nArteries & Veins\\nThe blood supply to the tubes is derived from the ovarian and uterine arteries. The tubal branch of the\\nuterine artery courses along the lower surface of the uterine tube as far as the fimbriated extremity and\\nmay also send a branch to the ligamentum teres. The ovarian branch of the uterine artery runs along\\nthe attached border of the ovary and gives off a tubal branch. Both branches form cruciate\\nanastomoses in the mesosalpinx. The veins accompany the arteries.\\nLymphatics\\nThe lymphatic drainage occurs through trunks running retroperitoneally across and anterior to the\\nureter, into the lumbar nodes along the aorta, and inferior to the kidney.\\nOvaries\\nAnatomy\\nThe ovaries are paired organs situated close to the wall on either side of the pelvis minor, a little\\nbelow the brim. Each measures 2.5–5 cm in length, 1.5–3 cm in breadth, and 0.7–1.5 cm in width,\\nweighing about 4–8 g. The ovary has 2 surfaces, medial and lateral; 2 borders, anterior or mesovarian\\nand posterior or free; and 2 poles, upper or tubal and lower or uterine. When the uterus and adnexa are\\nin the normal position, the long axis of the ovary is nearly vertical, but it bends somewhat medially\\nand forward at the lower end so that the lower pole tends to point toward the uterus. The medial\\nsurface is rounded and, posteriorly, may have numerous scars or elevations that mark the position of\\ndeveloping follicles and sites of ruptured ones.\\nStructure of Ovary\\nThe ovary is covered by cuboid or low columnar epithelium and consists of a cortex and a medulla.\\nThe medulla is made up of connective tissue fibers, smooth muscle cells, and numerous blood vessels,\\nnerves, lymphatic vessels, and supporting tissue.

It is short and wide and contains branches of the ovarian and uterine arteries, with\\nplexuses of nerves, the pampiniform plexus of veins, and the lateral end of the ovarian ligament. The\\nsuspensory ligament of the ovary is a triangular fold of peritoneum and is actually the upper lateral\\ncorner of the broad ligament, which becomes confluent with the parietal peritoneum at the pelvic\\nbrim. It attaches to the mesovarium as well as to the peritoneal coat of the infundibulum medially,\\nthus suspending both the ovary and the tube. It contains the ovarian artery, veins, and nerves after they\\npass over the pelvic brim and before they enter the mesovarium.\\nThe ovarian ligament is a band of connective tissue, with numerous small muscle fibers, that lies\\nbetween the 2 layers of the broad ligament on the boundary line between the mesosalpinx and the\\nmesometrium, connecting the lower (uterine) pole of the ovary with the lateral wall of the uterus.

The smooth muscle fibers are\\nindistinctly arranged in 3 layers: an outer longitudinal layer, circumferential layer, and a poorly\\ndifferentiated inner longitudinal layer. In the lower third, the circumferential fibers envelop the\\nurethra. The submucous area is abundantly supplied with a dense plexus of veins and lymphatics. The\\nmucous layer shows many transverse and oblique rugae, which project inward to such an extent that\\nthe lumen in transverse section resembles an H-shaped slit. On the anterior and posterior walls, these\\nridges are more prominent, and the anterior column forms the urethral carina at its lower end, where\\nthe urethra slightly invaginates the anterior wall of the vagina.

The uterine artery eventually\\nanastomoses to the urethral branch of the clitoral artery. The posterior vaginal wall is supplied by\\nbranches of the middle and inferior hemorrhoidal arteries, traversing toward the midline to join the\\nazygos artery from the coronary artery of the cervix. These branches then anastomose on the perineum\\nto the superficial and deep transverse perineal arteries. The veins follow the course of the arteries.\\nLymphatics\\nThe lymphatics are numerous mucosal plexuses, anastomosing with the deeper muscular plexuses.\\nThe superior group of lymphatics joins those of the cervix and may follow the uterine artery to\\nterminate in the external iliac nodes or form anastomoses with the uterine plexus. The middle group of\\nlymphatics, which drain the greater part of the vagina, appears to follow the vaginal arteries to the\\nhypogastric channels. In addition, there are lymph nodes in the rectovaginal septum that are primarily\\nresponsible for drainage of the rectum and part of the posterior vaginal wall. The inferior group of\\nlymphatics forms frequent anastomoses between the right and left sides and either courses upward to\\nanastomose with the middle group or enters the vulva and drains to the inguinal nodes.\\nNerves\\nThe innervation of the vagina contains both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibers.

Etiologies of congenital malformations are sometimes\\ncategorized on the basis of genetic, environmental, or genetic-plus-environmental (so-called\\npolyfactorial inheritance) factors. Known genetic and inheritance factors reputedly account for about\\n20% of anomalies detected at birth, aberration of chromosomes for nearly 5%, and environmental\\nfactors for nearly 10%. The significance of these statistics must be viewed against reports that (1) an\\nestimated one-third to one-half of human zygotes are lost during the first week of gestation and (2) the\\ncause of possibly 70% of human anomalies is unknown. Even so, congenital malformations remain a\\nmatter of concern because they are detected in nearly 3% of infants, and 20% of perinatal deaths are\\npurportedly due to congenital anomalies.\\nThe inherent pattern of normal development of the genital system can be viewed as one directed\\ntoward somatic “femaleness,” unless development is directed by factors for “maleness.” The presence\\nand expression of a Y chromosome (and its testis-determining genes) in a normal 46,XY karyotype of\\nsomatic cells directs differentiation toward a testis, and normal development of the testis makes\\navailable hormones for the selection and differentiation of the genital ducts. When male hormones are\\npresent, the mesonephric (wolffian) system persists; when male hormones are not present, the\\n“female” paramesonephric (müllerian) ducts persist. Normal feminization or masculinization of the\\nexternal genitalia is also a result of the respective timely absence or presence of androgen.\\nAn infant usually is reared as female or male according to the appearance of the external genitalia.\\nHowever, genital sex is not always immediately discernible, and the choice of sex of rearing can be an\\nanxiety-provoking consideration. Unfortunately, even when genital sex is apparent, later clinical\\npresentation may unmask disorders of sexual differentiation that can lead to problems in\\npsychological adjustment. Whether a somatic disorder is detected at birth or later, investigative\\nbacktracking through the developmental process is necessary for proper diagnosis and treatment.\\nOverview of the First 4 Weeks of Development\\n*\\nTransformation of the bilaminar embryonic disk into a trilaminar disk composed of \\nectoderm,\\nmesoderm\\n, and \\nendoderm\\n (the 3 embryonic germ layers) occurs during the third week by a process\\ncalled \\ngastrulation\\n (\\nFig. 2–1\\n).

However, early morphologic indications of the\\nsex of the developing embryo do not appear until about the eighth or ninth week after conception.\\nThus, there is a so-called \\nindifferent stage\\n, when morphologic identity of sex is not clear or when\\npreferential differentiation for one sex has not been imposed on the sexless primordia. This is\\ncharacteristic of early developmental stages for the gonads, genital ducts, and external genitalia.\\nWhen the influence of genetic sex has been expressed on the indifferent gonad, \\ngonadal sex\\n is\\nestablished. The \\nSRY (sex-determining region of the Y chromosome\\n) gene in the short arm of the Y\\nchromosome of normal genetic males is considered the best candidate for the gene encoding for the\\ntestis-determining factor (TDF\\n). TDF initiates a chain of events that results in differentiation of the\\ngonad into a testis with its subsequent production of antimüllerian hormone and testosterone, which\\ninfluences development of somatic “maleness” (see Testis). Normal genetic females do not have the\\nSRY gene, and the early undifferentiated medullary region of their presumptive gonad does not\\nproduce the TDF (see Ovary).\\nThe testis and ovary are derived from the same primordial tissue, but histologically visible\\ndifferentiation toward a testis occurs sooner than that toward an ovary. An “ovary” is first recognized\\nby the absence of testicular histogenesis (eg, thick tunica albuginea) or by the presence of germ cells\\nentering meiotic prophase between the 8th and about the 11th week.

The 2 primary testicular products are androgenic steroids\\n(\\ntestosterone\\n and nonsteroidal \\nantimüllerian hormone\\n) (see Testis). Stimulation by testosterone\\ninfluences the persistence and differentiation of the “male” mesonephric ducts (\\nwolffian ducts\\n),\\nwhereas antimüllerian hormone influences regression of the “female” paramesonephric ducts\\n(\\nmüllerian ducts\\n). Absence of these hormones in a nonaberrant condition specifies persistence of\\nmüllerian ducts and regression of wolffian ducts (ie, initiation of development of the uterus and\\nuterine tubes). \\nGenital sex\\n (external genitalia) subsequently develops according to the absence or\\npresence of androgen.

The indifferent stage in the female ends\\naround the ninth week, when the first oogonia enter meiotic prophase.\\nPrimordial germ cells\\n, presumptive progenitors of the gametes, become evident in the late third to\\nearly fourth week in the dorsocaudal wall of the yolk sac and the mesenchyme around the allantois.\\nThe \\nallantois\\n is a caudal diverticulum of the yolk sac that extends distally into the primitive umbilical\\nstalk and, after embryonic flexion, is adjacent proximally to the cloacal hindgut.

Antimüllerian hormone causes regression of the paramesonephric\\n(müllerian) ducts, apparently during a very discrete period of ductal sensitivity in male fetuses.

Mesonephric-derived cells may also be a primordial source of Leydig cells.\\nSteroidogenic activity of Leydig cells begins near the 10th week.

Some of the central mesonephric cells\\ngive rise to the rete system that subsequently forms a network of cords (\\nintraovarian rete cords\\n)\\nextending to the primitive cortical area. As these cords extend peripherally between germ clusters,\\nseveral epithelial cell proliferations extend centrally, and some mixing of these somatic cells\\napparently takes place around the germ cell clusters. These early cordlike structures are more\\nirregularly distributed than early cords in the testis and not distinctly outlined. The cords open into\\nclusters of germ cells, but all germ cells are not confined to cords.

These somatic\\ncells are morphologically similar to the mesonephric cells that form the intraovarian rete cords\\nassociated with the oocytes and apparently differentiate into the presumptive granulosa cells of the\\nearly follicle. Folliculogenesis continues peripherally. Between weeks 12 and 20 of gestation,\\nproliferative activity causes the surface epithelium to become a thickened, irregular multilayer of\\ncells. In the absence of a basal lamina, the cells and apparent epithelial cell cords mix with underlying\\ntissues. These latter cortical cords often retain a connection to and appear similar to the surface\\nepithelium. The epithelial cells of these cords probably differentiate into granulosa cells and\\ncontribute to folliculogenesis, although this occurs after the process is well under way in the central\\nregion of the gonad.

Anomalies of the Ovaries\\nAnomalies of the ovaries encompass a broad range of developmental errors from complete absence of\\nthe ovaries to supernumerary ovaries.

It can be difficult to distinguish one type from the\\nother on a practical basis. For example, a patient with female genital ducts and external genitalia and a\\n46,XY karyotype could represent either gonadal agenesis or agonadism.

The cause of agonadism is unknown, although several\\nexplanations have been suggested, such as (1) failure of the primordial gonad to form, along with\\nabnormal formation of ductal anlagen, and (2) partial differentiation and then regression and\\nabsorption of testes (accounting for suppression of müllerian ducts but lack of stimulation of\\nmesonephric, or wolffian, ducts). Explanations that include teratogenic effects or genetic defects are\\nmore likely candidates in view of the associated incidence of nonsexual somatic anomalies with the\\ndisorder. The \\nstreak gonad\\n is a product of primordial gonadal formation and subsequent failure of\\ndifferentiation, which can occur at various stages.

The cloaca is a pouchlike enlargement of the caudal end of the hindgut and is formed\\nby the process of “folding” of the caudal region of the embryonic disk between 4 and 5 weeks’\\ngestation (see Overview of the First 4 Weeks of Development; \\nFigs. 2–1\\n and \\n2–3\\n). During the “tail-\\nfold” process, the posteriorly placed allantois, or allantoic diverticulum of the yolk sac, becomes an\\nanterior extension of the cloaca (\\nFigs. 2–3\\n and \\n2–5\\n). Soon after the cloaca forms, it receives\\nposterolaterally the caudal ends of the paired mesonephric ducts and hence becomes a junctional\\ncistern for the allantois, the hindgut, and the ducts. A \\ncloacal membrane\\n, composed of ectoderm and\\nendoderm, is the caudal limit of the primitive gut and temporarily separates the cloacal cavity from\\nthe extraembryonic confines of the amniotic cavity (\\nFig. 2–5\\n).\\nBetween weeks 5 and 7, 3 wedges of splanchnic mesoderm, collectively called the \\nurorectal\\nseptum\\n, proliferate in the coronal plane in the caudal region of the embryo to eventually subdivide the\\ncloaca (\\nFigs. 2–5\\n to \\n2–8\\n). The superior wedge, called the \\nTourneux fold\\n, is in the angle between the\\nallantois and the primitive hindgut, and it proliferates caudally into the superior end of the cloaca\\n(\\nFig. 2–5\\n). The other 2 mesodermal wedges, called the \\nRathke folds\\n, proliferate in the right and left\\nwalls of the cloaca. Beginning adjacent to the cloacal membrane, these laterally placed folds grow\\ntoward each other and the Tourneux fold. With fusion of the 3 folds creating a urorectal septum, the\\nonce single chamber is subdivided into the primitive \\nurogenital sinus\\n (ventrally) and the \\nanorectal\\ncanal\\n of the hindgut (dorsally; \\nFigs. 2–6\\n to \\n2–8\\n). The mesonephric ducts and allantois then open into\\nthe sinus. The uterovaginal primordium of the fused paramesonephric ducts will contact the sinusal\\nwall between the mesonephric ducts early in the ninth week of development. However, it can be noted\\nthat the junctional point of fusion of the cloacal membrane and urorectal septum forms the \\nprimitive\\nperineum\\n (later differentiation creates the so-called perineal body of tissue) and subdivides the'),\n",

The 2 pairs of genital ducts share\\na close anatomic relationship in their bilateral course through the urogenital ridge. At their caudal\\nlimit, both sets contact the part of the cloaca that is later separated as the urogenital sinus (\\nFigs. 2–5\\n,\\n2–6\\n, and \\n2–10\\n). \\nDetermination of the ductal sex of the embryo (ie, which pair of ducts will continue\\ndifferentiation rather than undergo regression) is established initially by the gonadal sex and later by\\nthe continuing influence of hormones\\n.'),\n",

Diagrammatic comparison between male and female differentiation of internal genitalia.\\nFormation of each paramesonephric duct begins early in the sixth week as an invagination of\\ncoelomic epithelium in the lateral wall of the cranial end of the urogenital ridge and adjacent to each\\nmesonephric duct. The free edges of the invaginated epithelium join to form the duct except at the site\\nof origin, which persists as a funnel-shaped opening, the future \\nostium of the oviduct\\n. At first, each\\nparamesonephric duct grows caudally through the mesenchyme of the urogenital ridge and laterally\\nparallel to a mesonephric duct. More inferiorly, the paramesonephric duct has a caudomedial course,\\npassing ventral to the mesonephric duct. As it follows the ventromedial bend of the caudal portion of\\nthe urogenital ridge, the paramesonephric duct then lies medial to the mesonephric duct, and its caudal\\ntip lies in close apposition to its counterpart from the opposite side (\\nFig. 2–10\\n). At approximately the\\neighth week, the caudal segments of the right and left ducts fuse medially and their lumens coalesce to\\nform a single cavity. This conjoined portion of the Y-shaped paramesonephric ducts becomes the\\nuterovaginal primordium, or canal.\\nMale: Genital Ducts\\nA. Mesonephric Ducts\\nThe mesonephric ducts persist in the male and, under the stimulatory influence of testosterone,\\ndifferentiate into the internal genital ducts (epididymis, ductus deferens, and ejaculatory ducts). Near\\nthe cranial end of the duct, some of the mesonephric tubules (epigenital mesonephric tubules) of the\\nmesonephric kidney persist lateral to the developing testis. These tubules form a connecting link, the\\nductuli efferentes\\n, between the duct and the rete testis (\\nFig. 2–10\\n). The cranial portion of each duct\\nbecomes the convoluted \\nductus epididymis\\n. The \\nductus deferens\\n forms when smooth muscle from\\nadjacent splanchnic mesoderm is added to the central segment of the mesonephric duct. The seminal\\nvesicle develops as a lateral bud from each mesonephric duct just distal to the junction of the duct and\\nthe urogenital sinus (\\nFig. 2–7\\n). The terminal segment of the duct between \\nthe sinus and seminal\\nvesicle forms the \\nejaculatory duct\\n, which becomes encased by the developing prostate gland early in\\nthe 12th week (see Differentiation of the Urogenital Sinus). A vestigial remnant of the duct may\\npersist cranially near the head of the epididymis as the \\nappendix epididymis\\n, whereas remnants of\\nmesonephric tubules near the inferior pole of the testis and tail of the epididymis may persist as the\\nparadidymis\\n (\\nFig. 2–10\\n).\\nB. Paramesonephric Ducts\\nThe paramesonephric ducts begin to undergo morphologic regression centrally (and progress cranially\\nand caudally) about the time they meet the urogenital sinus caudally (approximately the start of the\\nninth week). Regression is effected by nonsteroidal antimüllerian hormone produced by the\\ndifferentiating Sertoli cells slightly before androgen is produced by the Leydig cells (see Testis).\\nAntimüllerian hormone is produced from the time of early testicular differentiation until birth (ie, not\\nonly during the period of regression of the paramesonephric duct). However, ductal sensitivity to\\nantimüllerian hormone in the male seems to exist for only a short “critical” time preceding the first\\nsigns of ductal regression. Vestigial remnants of the cranial end of the ducts may persist as the\\nappendix testis\\n on the superior pole of the testis (\\nFig. 2–10\\n).

Paramesonephric Ducts\\nDifferentiation of müllerian ducts in female embryos produces the uterine tubes, uterus, and probably\\nthe fibromuscular wall of the vagina. In contrast to the ductal/gonadal relationship in the male, ductal\\ndifferentiation in the female does not require the presence of ovaries. Formation of the bilateral\\nparamesonephric ducts during the second half of the embryonic period has been described [see\\nIndifferent (Sexless) Stage]. By the onset of the fetal period, the 2 ducts are joined caudally in the\\nmidline, and the fused segment of the new Y-shaped ductal structure is the \\nuterovaginal primordium\\n(\\nFig. 2–8\\n). The nonfused cranial part of each paramesonephric duct gives rise to the \\nuterine tubes\\n(oviducts), and the distal end of this segment remains open and will form the \\nostium of the oviduct\\n.\\nEarly in the ninth week, the uterovaginal primordium contacts medianly the dorsal wall of the\\nurogenital sinus. This places the primordium at a median position between the bilateral openings of\\nthe mesonephric ducts, which joined the dorsal wall during the fifth week before subdivision of the\\nurogenital sinus from the cloaca occurred (\\nFigs. 2–8\\n and \\n2–9\\n). A ventral protrusion of the dorsal wall\\nof the urogenital sinus forms at the area of contact of the uterovaginal primordium with the wall and\\nbetween the openings of the mesonephric ducts. In reference to its location, this protrusion is called\\nthe \\nsinusal tubercle (sinus tubercle, paramesonephric tubercle, müllerian tubercle\\n). This tubercle\\nmay consist of several types of epithelia derived from the different ducts as well as from the wall of\\nthe sinus.\\nShortly after the sinusal tubercle forms, midline fusion of the middle and caudal portions of the\\nparamesonephric ducts is complete, and the vertical septum (apposed walls of the fused ducts) within\\nthe newly established uterovaginal primordium degenerates, creating a single cavity or canal (\\nFig. 2–\\n12\\n). The solid tip of this primordium continues to grow caudally, while a mesenchymal thickening\\ngradually surrounds the cervical region of the uterovaginal primordium. The primordium gives rise to\\nthe fundus, body, and isthmus of the uterus, specifically the endometrial epithelium and glands of the\\nuterus.

Relocation of the Ovaries & Formation of Ligaments\\nTransabdominal “descent” of the ovary, unlike that of the testis, is restricted to a relatively short\\ndistance, presumably (at least partly) because of attachment of the gubernaculum to the\\nparamesonephric duct. Hence, relocation of the ovary appears to involve both (1) a passive rotatory\\nmovement of the ovary as its mesentery is drawn by the twist of the developing ductal mesenteries\\nand (2) extensive growth of the lumbosacral region of the fetus. The ovarian vessels (like the\\ntesticular vessels) originate or drain near the point of development of the gonad, the arteries from the\\naorta just inferior to the renal arteries and the veins to the left renal vein or to the vena cava from the\\nright gonad.\\nInitial positioning of the ovary on the anteromedial aspect of the urogenital ridge is depicted in\\nFigure 2–10\\n, as is the relationship of the paramesonephric duct lateral to the degenerating\\nmesonephros, the ovary, and the urogenital mesentery. The urogenital mesentery between the ridge\\nand the dorsal body wall represents the first mesenteric support for structures developing in the ridge.\\nAlterations within the urogenital ridge eventually result in formation of contiguous double-layered\\nmesenteries supporting the ovary and segments of the paramesonephric ducts. Enlargement of the\\novary and degeneration of the adjacent mesonephric tissue bring previously separated layers of\\ncoelomic mesothelium into near apposition, establishing the mesentery of the ovary, the \\nmesovarium\\n.\\nLikewise, mesonephric degeneration along the region of differentiation of the unfused cranial segment\\nof the paramesonephric ducts establishes the \\nmesosalpinx\\n. Caudally, growth and fusion\\nventromedially of these bilateral ducts “sweep” the once medially attached mesenteries of the ducts\\ntoward the midline. These bilateral mesenteries merge over the fused uterovaginal primordium and\\nextend laterally to the pelvic wall to form a continuous double-layered “drape,” the \\nmesometrium of\\nthe broad ligament\\n, between the upper portion of the primordium and the posterolateral body wall.\\nThis central expanse of mesentery creates the rectouterine and vesicouterine pouches. The midline\\ncaudal fusion of the ducts also alters the previous longitudinal orientation of the upper free segments\\nof the ducts (the oviducts) to a near transverse orientation. During this alteration, the attached\\nmesovarium is drawn from a medial relationship into a posterior relationship with the\\nparamesonephric mesentery of the mesosalpinx and the mesometrium.\\nThe \\nsuspensory ligament of the ovary\\n, through which the ovarian vessels, nerves, and lymphatics\\ntraverse, forms when cranial degeneration of the mesonephric tissue and regression of the urogenital\\nridge adjacent to the ovary reduce these tissues to a peritoneal fold.\\nThe \\nround ligament of the uterus\\n and the \\nproper ovarian ligament\\n are both derivatives of the\\ngubernaculum\\n, which originates as a mesenchymal condensation at the caudal end of the\\nmesonephros and extends over the initially short distance to the anterior abdominal wall (see\\nRelocation of the Testes and Ducts). As the gonad enlarges and the mesonephric tissue degenerates,\\nthe cranial attachment of the gubernaculum appears to “shift” to the inferior aspect of the ovary.\\nDistally, growth of the fibrous gubernaculum continues into the inguinal region. However, the\\nmidportion of the gubernaculum becomes attached, inexplicably, to the paramesonephric duct at the\\nuterotubal junction. Formation of the uterovaginal primordium by caudal fusion of the\\nparamesonephric ducts apparently carries the attached gubernaculum medially within the cover of the\\nencompassing mesentery of the structures (ie, the parts of the developing broad ligament).

Anomalies of the Uterine Tubes (Oviducts, Fallopian Tubes\\n)\\nThe uterine tubes are derivatives of the cranial segments of the paramesonephric (müllerian) ducts,\\nwhich differentiate in the urogenital ridge between the sixth and ninth weeks (\\nFig. 2–10\\n). Ductal\\nformation begins with invagination of the coelomic epithelium in the lateral coelomic bay. The initial\\ndepression remains open to proliferate and differentiate into the ostium (\\nFig. 2–10\\n). Variable degrees\\nof \\nduplication of the ostium\\n sometimes occur; in such cases, the leading edges of the initial ductal\\ngroove presumably did not fuse completely or anomalous proliferation of epithelium around the\\nopening occurred.\\nAbsence of a uterine tube\\n is very rare when otherwise normal ductal and genital derivatives are\\npresent. This anomaly has been associated with (1) ipsilateral absence of an ovary and (2) ipsilateral\\nunicornuate uterus (and probable anomalous broad ligament). Bilateral absence of the uterine tubes is\\nmost frequently associated with lack of formation of the uterus and anomalies of the external\\ngenitalia. Interestingly, absence of the derivatives of the lower part of the müllerian ducts with\\npersistence of the uterine tubes occurs more frequently than the reverse condition. This might be\\nexpected, as the müllerian ducts form in a craniocaudal direction.\\nPartial absence\\n of a uterine tube (middle or caudal segment) also has been reported. The cause of\\npartial absence is unknown, although several theories have been advanced. One theory holds that when\\nthe unilateral anomaly coincides with ipsilateral ovarian absence, a “vascular accident” might occur\\nfollowing differentiation of the ducts and ovaries. Obviously, various factors resulting in somewhat\\nlocalized atresia could be proposed. From a different perspective, bilateral absence of the uterine\\ntubes as an associated disorder in a female external phenotype is characteristic of \\ntesticular\\nfeminization syndrome or androgen insensitivity syndrome\\n (nonpersistence of the rest of the\\nparamesonephric ducts, anomalous external genitalia, hypoplastic male genital ducts, and testicular\\ndifferentiation with usual ectopic location).\\nE. Anomalies of the Uterus\\nThe epithelium of the uterus and cervix and the fibromuscular wall of the vagina are derived from the\\nparamesonephric (müllerian) ducts, the caudal ends of which fuse medially to form the uterovaginal\\nprimordium. Most of the primordium gives rise to the uterus (\\nFig. 2–13\\n). Subsequently, the caudal tip\\nof the primordium contacts the pelvic part of the urogenital sinus, and the interaction of the sinus\\n(sinovaginal bulbs) and primordium leads to differentiation of the vagina. Various steps in this\\nsequential process can go awry, such as (1) complete or partial failure of one or both ducts to form\\n(agenesis), (2) lack of or incomplete fusion of the caudal segments of the paired ducts (abnormal\\nuterovaginal primordium), or (3) failure of development \\nafter\\n successful formation (aplasia or\\nhypoplasia). Many types of anomalies may occur because of the number of sites for potential error,\\nthe complex interactions necessary for the development of the müllerian derivatives, and the duration\\nof the complete process.\\nComplete \\nagenesis of the uterus\\n is very rare, and associated vaginal anomalies are usually\\nexpected. Also, a high incidence of associated structural or positional abnormalities of the kidney has\\nbeen reported; there has been speculation that the initial error in severe cases may be in the\\ndevelopment of the urinary system and then in the formation of the paramesonephric ducts.'),\n",

For purposes of describing the origin of sinusal\\nderivatives, the sinus can be divided into 3 parts: (1) the \\nvesical part\\n, or the large dilated segment\\nsuperior to the entrance of the mesonephric ducts; (2) the \\npelvic part\\n, or the narrowed tubular\\nsegment between the level of the mesonephric ducts and the inferior segment; and (3) the \\nphallic\\npart\\n, often referred to as the definitive urogenital sinus (the anteroposteriorly elongated, transversely\\nflattened inferiormost segment) (\\nFig. 2–8\\n). The \\nurogenital membrane\\n temporarily closes the inferior\\nlimit of the phallic part. The superior limit of the vesical part becomes delimited by conversion of the\\nonce tubular allantois to a thick fibrous cord, the \\nurachus\\n, by about 12 weeks. After differentiation of\\nthe vesical part of the sinus to form the epithelium of the \\nurinary bladder\\n, the urachus maintains its\\ncontinuity between the apex of the bladder and the umbilical cord and is identified postnatally as the\\nmedian umbilical ligament\\n. Various anomalies of urachal formation can present as \\nurachal fistula,\\ncyst\\n, or \\nsinus\\n, depending on the degree of patency that persists during obliteration of the allantois.\\nIn both sexes, the caudal segments of each mesonephric duct between the urogenital sinus and the\\nlevel of the ureter of the differentiating metanephric diverticulum (or ureteric bud) become\\nincorporated into the posterocaudal wall of the vesical part (ie, urinary bladder) of the sinus (\\nFigs. 2–5\\nand \\n2–6\\n). As the dorsal wall of the bladder grows and “absorbs” these caudal segments, the ureters are\\ngradually “drawn” closer to the bladder and eventually open directly and separately into it,\\ndorsolateral to the mesonephric ducts (\\nFigs. 2–6\\n and \\n2–7\\n). The mesodermal segment of mesonephric\\nduct incorporated into the bladder defines the epithelium of the \\ntrigone of the bladder\\n, although this\\nmesodermal epithelium is secondarily replaced by the endodermal epithelium of the sinusal bladder.\\nAfter formation of the trigone, the remainder of each mesonephric duct (ie, the portion that was\\ncranial to the metanephric diverticulum) is joined to the superior end of the pelvic part of the\\nurogenital sinus. Thereafter, the ducts either degenerate (in females) or undergo differentiation (in\\nmales).\\nMale: Urinary Bladder, Urethra, & Penis (\\nFig. 2–15\\n)\\nThe urogenital sinus gives rise to the endodermal epithelium of the \\nurinary bladder\\n, the prostatic and\\nmembranous urethra, and most of the spongy (penile) urethra (except the glandular urethra).\\nOutgrowths from its derivatives produce epithelial parts of the prostate and bulbourethral glands (\\nFig.\\n2–15\\n). The \\nprostatic urethra\\n receives the ejaculatory ducts (derived from the mesonephric ducts) and\\narises from 2 parts of the urogenital sinus. The portion of this urethral segment superior to the\\nejaculatory ducts originates from the inferiormost area of the vesical part of the sinus. The lower\\nportion of the prostatic urethra is derived from the pelvic part of the sinus near the entrance of the\\nducts and including the region of the sinusal tubercle—the latter apparently forming the seminal\\ncolliculus.

The phallus and\\nurogenital folds gradually elongate to initiate development of the \\npenis\\n. The subjacent endodermal\\nlining of the inferior part (phallic) of the urogenital sinus extends anteriorly along with the urogenital\\nfolds, creating an endodermal plate, the \\nurethral plate\\n. The plate deepens into a groove, the \\nurethral\\ngroove\\n, as the urogenital folds (now called \\nurethral folds\\n) thicken on each side of the plate. The\\nurethral groove extends into the ventral aspect of the developing penis, and the bilateral urethral folds\\nslowly fuse in a posterior to anterior direction over the urethral groove to form the \\nspongy (penile)\\nurethra\\n, thereby closing the urogenital orifice (\\nFig. 2–15\\n; see also \\nFig. 2–20\\n).

Controversy exists about how the vagina is formed, mainly because of a lack of consensus\\nabout the origin and degree of inclusion of its precursory tissues (mesodermal paramesonephric duct,\\nendodermal urogenital sinus, or even mesonephric duct). The most common theory is that 2\\nendodermal outgrowths, the \\nsinovaginal bulbs\\n, of the dorsal wall of the pelvic part of the urogenital\\nsinus form bilateral to and join with the caudal tip of the uterovaginal primordium (fused\\nparamesonephric ducts) in the area of the sinusal tubercle (\\nFig. 2–12\\n). This cellular mass at the end of\\nthe primordium occludes the inferior aspect of the canal, creating an endodermal \\nvaginal plate\\n within\\nthe mesodermal wall of the uterovaginal primordium. Eventually, the vaginal segment grows,\\napproaching the vestibule of the vagina. The process of growth has been described either as\\n“downgrowth” of the vaginal segment away from the uterine canal and along the urogenital sinus or,\\nmore commonly, as “upgrowth” of the segment away from the sinus and toward the uterovaginal\\ncanal.

Applications of Mendelian Laws\\nIdentification of Carriers\\nWhen a recessive characteristic is present in a population, carriers may be identified in a variety of\\nways. If the gene is responsible for the production of a protein (eg, an enzyme), the carrier often\\npossesses 50% of the amount of the substance present in homozygous normal persons. Such a\\ncircumstance is found in galactosemia, where the carriers will have approximately half as much\\ngalactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase activity in red cells as do noncarrier normal individuals.\\nAt times, the level of the affected enzyme may be only slightly below normal, and a challenge with\\nthe substance to be acted upon may be required before the carrier can be identified. An example is\\nseen in carriers of phenylketonuria, in whom the deficiency in phenylalanine hydroxylase is in the\\nliver cells, and serum levels may not be much lower than normal. Nonetheless, when the individual is\\ngiven an oral loading dose of phenylalanine, plasma phenylalanine levels may remain high because\\nthe enzyme is not present in sufficient quantities to act upon this substance properly.\\nIn still other situations where the 2 alleles produce different proteins that can be measured, a\\ncarrier state will have 50% of the normal protein and 50% of the other protein. Such a situation is seen\\nin sickle cell trait, where 1 gene is producing hemoglobin A and the other hemoglobin S. Thus, the\\nindividual has half the amount of hemoglobin A as a normal person and half the hemoglobin S of a\\nperson with sickle cell anemia. An interesting but important problem involves the detection of carriers\\nof cystic fibrosis. This is the most common autosomal recessive disease in Caucasian populations of\\nEuropean background, occurring in 1 in 2500 births in such populations but found in the carrier state\\nin 1 in 25 Americans. By 1990, over 230 alleles of the single gene responsible have been discovered.\\nThe gene is known as the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), and the most\\ncommon mutation, delta F508, accounts for about 70% of all mutations, with 5 specific point\\nmutations accounting for over 85% of cases. Because so many alleles are present, population\\nscreening poses logistical problems that have yet to be worked out. Most programs screen for the most\\ncommon mutations using DNA replication and amplification studies.\\n3. Polygenic Inheritance\\nPolygenic inheritance is defined as the inheritance of a single phenotypic feature as a result of the\\neffects of many genes. Most physical features in humans are determined by polygenic inheritance.\\nMany common malformations are determined in this way also. For example, cleft palate with or\\nwithout cleft lip, clubfoot, anencephaly, meningomyelocele, dislocation of the hip, and pyloric\\nstenosis each occur with a frequency of 0.5–2 per 1000 in white populations. Altogether, these\\nanomalies account for slightly less than half of single primary defects noted in early infancy. They are\\npresent in siblings of affected infants—when both parents are normal—at a rate of 2–5%. They are\\nalso found more commonly among relatives than in the general population. The increase in incidence\\nis not environmentally induced because the frequency of such abnormalities in monozygotic twins is\\n4–8 times that of dizygotic twins and other siblings.

Certain conditions appear to be transmitted by polygenic inheritance and are\\npassed on more frequently by the mother who is affected than by the father who is affected. Cleft lip\\noccurs in 6% of the offspring of women with cleft lip, as opposed to 2.8% of offspring of men with\\ncleft lip.\\nMany racial variations in diseases are believed to be transmitted by polygenic inheritance, making\\nracial background a determinant of how prone an individual will be to a particular defect. In addition,\\nas a general rule, the more severe a defect, the more likely it is to occur in subsequent siblings. Thus,\\nsiblings of children with bilateral cleft lip are more likely to have the defect than are those of children\\nwith unilateral cleft lip.\\nEnvironment undoubtedly plays a role in polygenic inheritance, because seasonal variations alter\\nsome defects and their occurrence rate from country to country in similar populations.\\nEPIGENETIC\\nEpigenetic is the regulation of gene expression not encoded in the nucleotide sequence of the gene.\\nGene expression can either be turned on or off by DNA methylation or histone modification\\n(methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or ADP-ribosylation). Epigenetic can\\nsubsequently be inherited by its descendants.\\nGenomic Imprinting\\nGenomic imprinting is an epigenetic process by which the male and female genomes are differently\\nexpressed. The imprinting mark on genes is either by DNA methylation or histone modification. The\\nimprinting patterns are different according to the parental origin of the genes. Genomic imprints are\\nerased in primordial germ cells and reestablished again during gametogenesis. The imprinting process\\nis completed by the time of round spermatids formation in males and at ovulation of metaphase-II\\noocytes in females. The imprinted genes survive the global waves of DNA demethylation and\\nremethylation during early embryonic development. In normal children, 1 set of chromosomes is\\nderived from the father and the other from the mother. If both sets of chromosomes are from only 1\\nparent, the imprinted gene expression will be unbalanced. Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman\\nsyndrome are examples of imprinting disorders. In Prader-Willi syndrome, both 15q13 regions are\\nfrom the father, whereas in Angelman syndrome, both 15q13 regions are from the mother.\\nCYTOGENETICS\\n1. Identification of Chromosomes\\nIn 1960, 1963, 1965, and 1971, international meetings were held in Denver, London, Chicago, and\\nParis, respectively, for the purpose of standardizing the nomenclature of human chromosomes. These\\nmeetings resulted in a decision that all autosomal pairs should be numbered in order of decreasing\\nsize from 1 to 22. Autosomes are divided into groups based on their morphology, and these groups are\\nlabeled by the letters A–G. Thus, the A group is comprised of pairs 1–3; the B group, pairs 4 and 5; the\\nC group, pairs 6–12; the D group, pairs 13–15; the E group, pairs 16–18; the F group, pairs 19 and 20;\\nand the G group, pairs 21 and 22. The sex chromosomes are labeled X and Y, the X chromosome being\\nsimilar in size and morphology to the number 7 pair and thus frequently included in the C group (C-X)\\nand the Y chromosome being similar in morphology and size to the G group (G-Y) (\\nFig. 3–1\\n).'),\n",

The same can be said for the long arm (q+ and q−).\\nIt has been impossible to separate several chromosome pairs from one another on a strictly\\nmorphologic basis because the morphologic variations have been too slight. However, there are other\\nmeans of identifying each chromosome pair in the karyotype. The first of these is the incorporation of\\n3\\nH-thymidine, known as the autoradiographic technique. This procedure involves the incorporation of\\nradioactive thymidine into growing cells in tissue culture just before they are harvested. Cells that are\\nactively undergoing DNA replication will pick up the radioactive thymidine, and the chromosomes\\nwill demonstrate areas of activity. Each chromosome will incorporate thymidine in a different pattern,\\nand several chromosomes can therefore be identified by their labeling pattern. Nonetheless, with this\\nmethod it is not possible to identify each chromosome, although it is possible to identify\\nchromosomes involved in pathologic conditions, eg, D\\n1\\n trisomy and Down syndrome.\\nInnovative staining techniques have made it possible to identify individual chromosomes in the\\nkaryotype and to identify small anomalies that might have evaded the observer using older methods.\\nThese involve identification \\nof chromosome banding by a variety of staining techniques, at times with\\npredigestion with proteolytic agents. Some of the more commonly used techniques are the following:\\nQ banding\\n: Fixed chromosome spreads are stained without any pretreatment using quinacrine\\nmustard, quinacrine, or other fluorescent dyes and observed with a fluorescence microscope.\\nG banding\\n: Preparations are incubated in a variety of saline solutions using any 1 of several\\npretreatments and stained with Giemsa’s stain.\\nR banding\\n: Preparations are incubated in buffer solutions at high temperatures or at special pH and\\nstained with Giemsa’s stain. This process yields the reverse bands of G banding (\\nFig. 3–1\\n).\\nC banding\\n: Preparations are either heated in saline to temperatures just below boiling or treated\\nwith certain alkali solutions and then stained with Giemsa’s stain. This process causes prominent\\nbands to develop in the region of the centromeres.\\n2. Cell Division\\nEach body cell goes through successive stages in its life cycle. As a landmark, cell division can be\\nconsidered as the beginning of a cycle. Following this, the first phase, which is quite long but depends\\non how rapidly the particular cell is multiplying, is called the G\\n1\\n stage. During this stage, the cell is\\nprimarily concerned with carrying out its function. Following this, the S stage, or period of DNA\\nsynthesis, takes place. Next there is a somewhat shorter stage, the G\\n2\\n stage, during which time DNA\\nsynthesis is completed and chromosome replication begins. Following this comes the M stage, when\\ncell division occurs.\\nSomatic cells undergo division by a process known as \\nmitosis\\n (\\nFig. 3–2\\n). This is divided into 4\\nperiods. The first is \\nprophase\\n, during which the chromosome filaments shorten, thicken, and become\\nvisible. At this time they can be seen to be composed of 2 long parallel spiral strands lying adjacent to\\none another and containing a small clear structure known as the \\ncentromere\\n. As prophase continues,\\nthe strands continue to unwind and may be recognized as chromatids. At the end of prophase, the\\nnuclear membrane disappears and \\nmetaphase\\n begins. This stage is heralded by the formation of a\\nspindle and the lining up of the chromosomes in pairs on the spindle. Following this, \\nanaphase'),\n",

A\\nnuclear membrane \\nnow forms, and mitosis is complete. Each daughter cell has received chromosome\\nmaterial equal in amount and identical to that of the parent cell. Because each cell contains 2\\nchromosomes of each pair and a total of 46 chromosomes, a cell is considered to be \\ndiploid\\n.\\nOccasionally, an error takes place on the spindle, and instead of chromosomes dividing, with identical\\nchromatids going to each daughter cell, an extra chromatid goes to 1 daughter cell and the other lacks\\nthat particular member. After completion of cell division, this leads to a trisomic state (an extra dose\\nof that chromosome) in 1 daughter cell and a monosomic state (a missing dose of the chromosome) in\\nthe other daughter cell. Any chromosome in the karyotype may be involved in such a process, which is\\nknown as mitotic nondisjunction. If these cells thrive and produce their own progeny, a new cell line\\nis established within the individual. The individual then has more than 1 cell line and is known as a\\nmosaic\\n. A variety of combinations and permutations have occurred in humans.\\nFigure 3–2\\n. Mitosis of a somatic cell.\\nGerm cells undergo division for the production of eggs and sperm by a process known as \\nmeiosis\\n.\\nIn the female it is known as oogenesis and in the male as spermatogenesis. The process that produces\\nthe egg and the sperm for fertilization essentially reduces the chromosome number from 46 to 23 and\\nchanges the normal diploid cell to an aneuploid cell, ie, a cell that has only 1 member of each\\nchromosome pair. Following fertilization and the fusion of the 2 pronuclei, the diploid status is\\nreestablished.\\nMeiosis can be divided into several stages (\\nFig. 3–3\\n). The first is \\nprophase I\\n.

When it does, both members of the chromosome pair go\\nto 1 daughter cell and none to the other. If the daughter cell that receives the entire pair is the egg, and\\nfertilization ensues, a triple dose of the chromosome, or trisomy, will occur.

In the case of the sex chromosome, the condition\\nmay not be lethal, and examples of both trisomy and monosomy have been seen in humans. Any\\nchromosome pair may be involved in trisomic or monosomic conditions.\\n3. Abnormalities in Chromosome Morphology & Number\\nAs has been stated, nondisjunction may give rise to conditions of trisomy. In these cases, the\\nmorphology of the chromosome is not affected, but the chromosome number is. Be this as it may,\\nbreaks and rearrangements in chromosomes may have a variety of results. If 2 chromosomes undergo\\nbreaks and exchange chromatin material between them, the outcome is 2 morphologically new\\nchromosomes known as \\ntranslocations\\n. If a break in a chromosome takes place and the fragment is\\nlost, \\ndeletion\\n has occurred. If the deletion is such that the cell cannot survive, the condition may be\\nlethal. Nonetheless, several examples of deleted chromosomes in individuals who have survived have\\nbeen identified. If a \\nbreak takes place at either end of a chromosome and the chromosome heals by\\nhaving the 2 ends fuse together, a ring chromosome is formed. Examples of these have been seen\\nclinically in all of the chromosomes of the karyotype, and generally they exhibit a variety of\\nphenotypic abnormalities.\\nAt times a chromosome will divide by a horizontal rather than longitudinal split of the centromere.\\nThis leaves each daughter cell with a double dose of 1 of the arms of the chromosome. Thus, 1\\ndaughter cell receives both long arms and the other both short arms of the chromosome. Such a\\nchromosome is referred to as an \\nisochromosome\\n, the individual being essentially trisomic for 1 arm\\nand monosomic for the other arm of the chromosome. Examples of this abnormality have been seen in\\nhumans.\\nAnother anomaly that has been recognized is the occurrence of 2 breaks within the chromosome\\nand rotation of the center fragment 180 degrees. Thus, the realignment allows for a change in\\nmorphology of the chromosome, although the original number of genes is preserved. This is called an\\ninversion\\n. At meiosis, however, the chromosome has difficulty in undergoing chiasm formation, and\\nabnormal rearrangements of this chromosome, leading to partial duplications and partial losses of\\nchromatin material, do take place. This situation may lead to several bizarre anomalies. If the\\ncentromere is involved in the inversion, the condition is called a \\npericentric inversion\\n.\\nBreaks occasionally occur in 2 chromosomes, and a portion of 1 broken chromosome is inserted\\ninto the body of another, leading to a grossly abnormal chromosome.

It has been found to be the constricted, nonfunctioning X chromosome. As a general\\nrule, only 1 X chromosome functions in a cell at a given time. All other X chromosomes present in a\\ncell may be seen as X-chromatin bodies in a resting nucleus. Thus, if one knows the number of X\\nchromosomes, one can anticipate that the number of Barr bodies will be 1 less.

This is of\\nvalue with problems such as translocations and trisomic conditions. Another use depends on the fact\\nthat most of the long arm of the Y chromosome is heterochromic and stains deeply with fluorescent\\nstains. Thus, the Y chromosome can be identified at a glance, even in the resting nucleus.\\nAPPLIED GENETICS & TERATOLOGY\\n1. Chromosomes & Spontaneous Abortion\\nAn entirely new approach to reproductive biology problems became available with the advent of tissue\\nculture and cytologic techniques that made it possible to culture cells from any tissue of the body and\\nproduce karyotypes that could be analyzed. In the early 1960s, investigators in a number of\\nlaboratories began to study chromosomes of spontaneous abortions and demonstrated that the earlier\\nthe spontaneous abortion occurred, the more likely it was due to a chromosomal abnormality. It is now\\nknown that in spontaneous abortions occurring in the first 8 weeks, the fetuses have about a 50%\\nincidence of chromosome anomalies.\\nOf abortuses that are abnormal, approximately one-half are trisomic, suggesting an error of meiotic\\nnondisjunction. One-third of abortuses with trisomy have trisomy 16. Although this abnormality does\\nnot occur in liveborn infants, it apparently is a frequent problem in abortuses. The karyo-type 45,X\\noccurs in nearly one-fourth of chromosomally abnormal abortuses. This karyotype occurs about 24\\ntimes more frequently in abortuses than in liveborn infants, a fact that emphasizes its lethal nature.\\nOver 15% of chromosomally abnormal abortuses have polyploidy (triploidy or tetraploidy).

The condition is\\ndefined as 2 or more spontaneous abortions. Several investigators have studied groups of these\\ncouples using banding techniques and have found that 10–25% of them have a chromosome anomaly\\nin either the male or female partner. Those seen are 47,XXX, 47,XYY, and a variety of balanced\\ntranslocation carriers. Those with sex chromosome abnormalities frequently demonstrate other\\nnondisjunctional events. Chromosome anomalies are thus a major cause of habitual abortion, and the\\nincorporation of genetic evaluation into such a work-up is potentially fruitful.\\nLippman-Hand and Bekemans reviewed the world literature and studied the incidence of balanced\\ntranslocation carriers among 177 couples who had 2 or more spontaneous abortions. These studies\\nsuggest that in 2–3% of couples experiencing early fetal loss, 1 partner will have balanced\\ntranslocations. This percentage is not markedly increased when more than 2 abortions occur. Females\\nhad a somewhat higher incidence of balanced translocations than did males.\\n2. Chromosomal Disorders\\nThis section is devoted to a brief discussion of various autosomal abnormalities. \\nTable 3–5\\nsummarizes some of the autosomal abnormalities that have been diagnosed. They are represented as\\nsyndromes, together with some of the signs typical of these conditions. In general, autosomal\\nmonosomy is so lethal that total loss of a chromosome is rarely seen in an individual born alive. Only\\na few cases of monosomy 21–22 have been reported to date, which attests to the rarity of this disorder.\\nTrisomy may occur with any chromosome. The 3 most common trisomic conditions seen in living\\nindividuals are trisomies 13, 18, and 21. Trisomy of various C group chromosomes has been reported\\nsporadically. The most frequently reported is trisomy 8. Generally, trisomy of other chromosomes\\nmust be assumed to be lethal, because they occur only in abortuses, not in living individuals.

Babies\\nwith Down syndrome are more often born to teenage mothers and even more frequently to mothers\\nover 35. Although the reason for these findings is not entirely clear, it may be that, in older women at\\nleast, the egg has been present in prophase of the first meiotic division from the time of fetal life and\\nthat, as the egg ages, there is a greater tendency for nondisjunction to occur, leading to trisomy. A\\nsecond theory is that coital habits are more erratic in both the very young and the older mothers, and\\nthis may lead to an increased incidence of fertilization of older eggs. This theory maintains that these\\neggs may be more likely to suffer nondisjunction or to accept abnormal sperm. Be this as it may, the\\nincidence of Down syndrome in the general population is approximately 1 in 600 deliveries and at age\\n40 approximately 1 in 100 deliveries.

Prenatal Diagnosis\\nCurrently the most common use for applied genetics in obstetrics and gynecology is in prenatal\\ncounseling, screening, and diagnosis.

In general, if a couple has a child with such an anomaly, the chance of\\nproducing another affected child is 2–5%. If they have had 2 such children, the risk can be as high as\\n10%. However, other diagnostic possibilities involving different modes of inheritance should be\\nconsidered. Siblings also run greater risks of having affected children, with the highest risk being to\\nfemale offspring of sisters and the lowest to male offspring of brothers. Maternal serum screening is\\nnow available to all mothers between 16 and 20 weeks of gestation. If an elevation of 2.5 or more\\nstandard \\ndeviations above the mean is noted, amniocentesis for AFP should be done along with a\\ncareful ultrasound study of the fetus for structural anomalies. Evidence for an NTD noted on\\nultrasound and suspected by amniotic fluid AFP elevation of 3.0 or more standard deviations indicates\\na diagnosis of an NTD and allows for appropriate counseling and decision making for the parents.\\nMaternal serum AFP screening detects about 85% of all open NTDs, thus allowing detection of\\n80% of all open NTDs and 90% of all anencephalic infants. Serum AFP screening does not detect\\nskin-covered lesions or the closed form of NTDs. Thus, most encephaloceles may be missed.\\nApproximately 5–5.5% of women screened will have abnormally elevated values (≥ 2.5 times the\\nmean). Most of these will be false-positive results (a repeat test should determine this) due to\\ninaccurate dating of gestational age, multiple gestation, fetal demise or dying fetus, or a host of other\\nstructural abnormalities. In most cases, repeat AFP testing and ultrasound examination will identify\\nthe problem. If the serum AFP level remains elevated and ultrasound examination does not yield a\\nspecific diagnosis, amniotic fluid AFP levels should be measured as well as amniotic fluid\\nacetylcholinesterase levels. Further testing and counseling may be necessary before a final diagnosis\\ncan be made. When the correct gestational age is used, the false-positive rate for second-trimester\\nmaternal screening is 3–4%.\\nChromosomal Abnormalities\\nIn 1984, maternal serum AFP levels were found to be lower in patients who delivered infants with\\nDown syndrome. Using the AFP value with maternal age, 25–30% of fetuses with Down syndrome\\nwere detected prenatally. In 1988, 2 additional tests were added to the maternal AFP: human chorionic\\ngonadotropin (hCG) and unconjugated estriol (uE\\n3\\n). Using the “triple screen,” a 60% detection rate for\\nDown syndrome was accomplished. In addition, the use of uE\\n3\\n allowed for detection of trisomy 18.\\nFetuses with Down syndrome have low maternal AFP, low uE\\n3\\n, and high hCG. Fetuses with\\ntrisomy 18 have low values across all of the serum markers. The false-positive rate for women less\\nthan 35 years of age is 5%. Above this age cutoff, the false-positive rate is increased. The definitive\\ndiagnosis of a chromosomal abnormality must be confirmed with a fetal karyotype.\\nThe risk of fetal trisomies increases with increasing maternal age. At age 35 the risk of a trisomy is\\napproximately 1 in 200. At age 40 the risk is 1 in 20 (\\nTable 3–6\\n). Prior to the discovery of serum\\nmarkers, advanced maternal age was used to guide which women received fetal karyotyping.\\nTrisomies, however, are not the only abnormality increased in this population of women. Sex\\nchromosome aneuploidies (47,XXY and 47,XXX) also occur at an increased rate in women 35 years of\\nage and older. Despite the advances in serum screening, fetal karyotyping continues to be the gold\\nstandard for prenatal testing in this group of women. The use of maternal serum screening in this\\nsubset of women is hindered by a high false-positive rate, less than 100% detection rate for trisomy 18\\nand 21, and the lack of ability to screen for the sex chromosome aneuploidies.\\nCystic Fibrosis\\nCystic fibrosis affects 1 in 3300 individuals of European descent in the United States.

For couples who are both carriers of the defective\\nallele, fetal testing may be provided.\\nFuture Advances in Prenatal Screening\\nIn the detection of certain trisomies, the triple-marker screen provides better sensitivity than any\\nsingle marker alone. Nonetheless, the detection rate for trisomy 18 and trisomy 21 still remains quite\\nlow. According to the Serum Urine and Ultrasound Screening Study (SURUSS), integration of nuchal\\ntranslucency measurement and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) in the first trimester\\nimproves screening. This information in conjunction with early second-trimester measurement of\\nAFP, uE\\n3\\n, free β-hCG (or total hCG), and inhibin-A with maternal age provides the most effective\\nmethod for screening of Down syndrome, with an 85% detection rate and 0.9% false-positive rate. As\\nthe field of prenatal diagnostics continues to evolve, higher detection rates with lower false-positive\\nrates can be expected. With continued research and advancing technology, prenatal screening may\\nmove into the first trimester. It may involve new markers (proform of eosinophil major basic protein\\n[proMBP], nasal bone) and may even involve markers taken in both the first and second trimesters.\\nFetal Karyotyping\\nA. Amniocentesis\\nAmniocentesis for prenatal diagnosis of genetic diseases is an extremely useful tool in the following\\ncircumstances or classes of patients:\\n1. Maternal age 35 years or above\\n2. Previous chromosomally abnormal child\\n3. Three or more spontaneous abortions\\n4. Patient or husband with chromosome anomaly\\n5. Family history of chromosome anomaly\\n6. Possible female carrier of X-linked disease\\n7. Metabolic disease risk (because of previous experience or family history)\\n8. NTD risk (because of previous experience or family history)\\n9.

The underlying risk of amniocentesis when performed at 15 weeks of gestation and\\nbeyond is increased risk of miscarriage. This risk is estimated at 1 in 200 (0.5%), which is\\napproximately the risk of Down syndrome in a 35-year-old woman. When amniocentesis is performed\\nprior to 15 weeks, the miscarriage rate is slightly increased. \\nTable 3–7\\n lists some of the conditions\\nthat now can be diagnosed prenatally by biochemical means.'),\n",

Chorionic Villus Sampling\\nChorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a technique used in the first trimester to obtain villi for\\ncytogenetic testing. Most commonly, it is performed transcervically; however, transabdominal routes\\nmay also be attempted. The value of CVS is that it can be performed earlier in the pregnancy, and thus\\nthe decision of pregnancy termination can be made earlier. The downfall of CVS, however, is a\\nslightly higher miscarriage rate of 1–5% and an association with distal limb defects. These risks\\nappear to be dependent on operator experience, and lower numbers have been reported when CVS is\\nperformed between 10 and 12 weeks of gestation.\\nKaryotyping & Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Analysis\\nOnce the fetal cells are obtained, they must be processed. Formal karyotyping should be performed on\\nall specimens. This involves culturing the cells, replication, and eventually karyotyping. The entire\\nprocess often takes 10–14 days until the final report becomes available. Fortunately, a quicker\\nanalysis can be obtained for some of the most common chromosomal anomalies.\\nThe fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) study is a rapid assay for the detection of specific\\nchromosomal aneuploidies using fluorescent-labeled DNA probes. Currently, probes exist for\\nchromosomes 13, 18, 21, and 22, as well as the X and Y sex chromosomes among others. The average\\ntime to obtain a result is 24 hours. However, certain chromosomal probes may return as quickly as 4\\nhours. The more rapid turnaround time can be attained because the probes are mixed with uncultured\\namniocytes obtained from amniotic fluid or cells from CVS. If a patient is late in gestation or if the\\nultrasound is highly suggestive of a certain chromosomal composite, FISH analysis may be an\\nappropriate study. With the development of multicolor FISH, all human chromosomes are painted in\\n24 different colors, allowing identification of chromosome rearrangement.\\nSingle Gene Defects\\nIf 1 parent is affected and the condition is caused by an autosomal dominant disorder, the chances are\\n1 in 2 that a child will be affected.

When parents are carriers\\nand pregnancy has been diagnosed, prenatal diagnostic testing is indicated if a test is available. If a\\nphysician does not know whether or not a test exists or how to obtain the test, the local genetic\\ncounseling program, local chapter of the National Foundation/March of Dimes, or state health\\ndepartment should be called for consultation. These sources may be able to inform the physician about\\nnew research that may have produced a prenatal test. A new test may be likely because this area of\\nresearch is very dynamic.

If the\\nfetus is a male, the chances are 1 in 2 that it will be affected. With this information, the couple can\\ndecide whether or not to continue the pregnancy in the case of a male fetus. Again, checking with\\ngenetic counseling agencies may reveal a prenatal diagnostic test that has only recently been described\\nor information such as gene linkage studies that may apply in the individual case.\\nAll options should be presented in a nonjudgmental fashion with no attempt to persuade, based on\\nthe best information available at the time. The couple should be encouraged to decide on a course of\\naction that suits their particular needs. If the decision is appropriate, it should be supported by the\\nphysician and the genetic counselor. Very rarely, the patient will make a decision the physician\\nregards as unwise or unrealistic. Such a decision may be based on superstition, religious or mystical\\nbeliefs, simple naiveté, or even personality disorder. The physician should make every attempt to\\nclarify the issues for the patient. Rarely, other resources such as family members or spiritual leaders\\nmay be consulted in strict confidence.

The cells of normal females contain 2 X\\nchromosomes; those of normal males contain 1 X and 1 Y. During meiotic reduction, half of the male\\ngametes receive a Y chromosome and the other half an X chromosome. Because the female has 2 X\\nchromosomes, all female gametes contain an X chromosome. If a Y-bearing gamete fertilizes an\\novum, the fetus is male; conversely, if an X-bearing gamete fertilizes an ovum, the fetus is female.\\nArithmetically, the situation described previously should yield a male/female sex ratio of 100—the\\nsex ratio being defined as 100 times the number of males divided by the number of females. However,\\nfor many years, the male/female sex ratio of the newborns in the white population has been\\napproximately 105. Apparently the sex ratio at fertilization is even higher than at birth; most data on\\nthe sex of abortuses indicate a preponderance of males.\\nAbnormalities of Meiosis and Mitosis\\nThe discussion in this section is limited to anomalies of meiosis and mitosis that result in some\\nabnormality in the sex chromosome complement of the embryo.\\nChromosome studies in connection with various clinical conditions suggest that errors in meiosis\\nand mitosis do indeed occur. These errors result in any of the following principal effects: (1) an extra\\nsex chromosome, (2) an absent sex chromosome, (3) 2 cell lines having different sex chromosomes\\nand arising by mosaicism, (4) 2 cell lines having different sex chromosomes and arising by\\nchimerism, (5) a structurally abnormal sex chromosome, and (6) a sex chromosome complement\\ninconsistent with the phenotype.\\nBy and large, an extra or a missing sex chromosome arises as the result of an error of disjunction in'),\n",

In meiosis I, this means that instead of each of the\\npaired homologous sex chromosomes going to the appropriate daughter cell, both go to 1 cell, leaving\\nthat cell with an extra sex chromosome and the daughter cell with none. Failure of disjunction in\\nmeiosis II simply means that the centromere fails to divide normally.\\nA variation of this process, known as anaphase lag, occurs when 1 of the chromosomes is delayed\\nin arriving at the daughter cell and thus is lost. Theoretically, chromosomes may be lost by failure of\\nassociation in prophase and by failure of replication, but these possibilities have not been\\ndemonstrated.\\nPersons who have been found to have 2 cell lines apparently have experienced problems in mitosis\\nin the very early stage of embryogenesis. Thus, if there is nondisjunction or anaphase lag in an early\\n(first, second, or immediately subsequent) cell division in the embryo, mosaicism may be said to\\nexist. In this condition, there are 2 cell lines; 1 has a normal number of sex chromosomes, and the\\nother is deficient in a sex chromosome or has an extra number of sex chromosomes. A similar\\nsituation exists in chimerism, except that there may be a difference in the sex chromosome: 1 may be\\nan X and 1 may be a Y. This apparently arises by dispermy, by the fertilization of a double oocyte, or\\nby the fusion, very early in embryogenesis, of 2 separately fertilized oocytes. Each of these conditions\\nhas been produced experimentally in animals.\\nStructural abnormalities of the sex chromosomes—deletion of the long or short arm or the\\nformation of an isochromosome (2 short arms or 2 long arms)—result from injury to the\\nchromosomes during meiosis. How such injuries occur is not known, but the results are noted more\\ncommonly in sex chromosomes than in autosomes—perhaps because serious injury to an autosome is\\nmuch more likely to be lethal than injury to an X chromosome, and surviving injured X chromosomes\\nwould therefore be more common.\\nThe situation in which there is a sex chromosome complement with an inappropriate genotype\\narises in special circumstances of true hermaphroditism and XX males (see later sections).\\nThe X Chromosome in Humans\\nAt about day 16 of embryonic life, there appears on the undersurface of the nuclear membrane of the\\nsomatic cells of human females a structure 1 μm in diameter known as the X-chromatin body. There is\\ngenetic as well as cytogenetic evidence that this is 1 of the X chromosomes (the only chromosome\\nvisible by ordinary light microscopy during interphase). In a sense, therefore, all females are\\nhemizygous with respect to the X chromosome. However, there are genetic reasons for believing that\\nthe X chromosome is not entirely inactivated during the process of formation of the X-chromatin\\nbody. In normal females, inactivation of the X chromosome during interphase and its representation as\\nthe X-chromatin body are known as the Lyon phenomenon (for Mary Lyon, a British geneticist). This\\nphenomenon may involve, at random, either the maternal or the paternal X chromosome. Furthermore,\\nonce the particular chromosome has been selected early in embryogenesis, it is always the same X\\nchromosome that is inactivated in the progeny of that particular cell. Geneticists have found that the\\nratio of \\nmaternal to paternal X chromosomes inactivated is approximately 1:1.\\nThe germ cells of an ovary are an exception to the X inactivation concept in that X inactivation\\ndoes not characterize the meiotic process. Apparently, meiosis is impossible without 2 genetically\\nactive X chromosomes. Although random structural damage to 1 of the X chromosomes seems to\\ncause meiotic arrest, oocyte loss, and therefore failure of ovarian development, an especially critical\\narea necessary for oocyte development has been identified on the long arm of the X.

However, a few exceptions to this rule have been described.\\nIt is a curious biologic phenomenon that if 1 of the X chromosomes is abnormal, it is always this\\nchromosome that is genetically inactivated and becomes the X-chromatin body, regardless of whether\\nit is maternal or paternal in origin. Although this general rule seems to be an exception to the\\nrandomness of X inactivation, this is more apparent than real. Presumably, random inactivation does\\noccur, but the disadvantaged cells—ie, those left with a damaged active X—do not survive.\\nConsequently, the embryo develops only with cells with a normal active X chromosome (X-chromatin\\nbody) (\\nFig. 3–5\\n).\\nFigure 3–5\\n. Relation of X-chromatin body to the possible sex chromosome components.\\nIf there are more than 2 X chromosomes, all X chromosomes except 1 are genetically inactivated\\nand become X-chromatin bodies; thus, in this case, the number of X-chromatin bodies will be equal to\\nthe number of X chromosomes minus 1. This type of inactivation applies to X chromosomes even\\nwhen a Y chromosome is present, eg, in Klinefelter’s syndrome.\\nAlthough the X chromosomes are primarily concerned with the determination of femininity, there\\nis abundant genetic evidence that loci having to do with traits other than sex determination are present\\non the X chromosome. Thus, in the catalog of genetic disorders given in the 10th edition of \\nMendelian\\nInheritance in Man\\n, 320 traits are listed as more or less definitely X-linked. Substantial evidence for\\nX linkage has been found for about 160 of these traits; the rest are only suspected of having this\\nrelationship.

This is a very useful diagnostic method.\\nIn contrast to the X chromosome, few traits have been traced to the Y chromosome except those\\nhaving to do with testicular formation and those at the very tip of the short arm, homologous with\\nthose at the tip of the short arm of the X. Possession of the Y chromosome alone, ie, without an X\\nchromosome, apparently is lethal, because such a case has never been described.\\nPresent on the Y chromosome is an area that produces a factor that allows for testicular\\ndevelopment. This factor is termed testis-determining factor (TDF). Without the presence of TDF,\\nnormal female anatomy will develop. When TDF is present, testicular development occurs with\\nsubsequent differentiation of Sertoli cells. The Sertoli cells in turn produce a second factor central to\\nmale differentiation, müllerian-inhibiting factor (MIF), also termed antimüllerian factor (AMF). The\\npresence of MIF causes the regression of the müllerian ducts and thereby allows for the development\\nof normal internal male anatomy.\\nY-Chromosome Microdeletion\\nIn addition to sex determination function, human Y chromosome also has a role in spermatogenesis\\ncontrolled by multiple genes along proximal Yq. The locus for spermatogenesis is on \\nthe euchromatic\\npart of Yq (Yq11) called azoospermic factor (AZF). The AZF region is divided into three\\nnonoverlapping regions AZFa, AZFb, and AZFc. The term “microdeletion” means that the size of the\\ndeleted segment is not visualized on karyotyping but must be discerned through molecular biology\\ntechnique. There is no specific phenotype–genotype correlation between the degree of spermatogenic\\nfailure and type of Yq microdeletion. Complete deletion of AZFa and AZFb regions is associated with\\nSertoli cell-only syndrome and spermatogenic arrest, respectively. However, partial deletions of AZFa\\nor AZFb or complete/partial deletions of AZFc are associated with a variable degree of spermatogenic\\nfailure ranging from oligozoospermia to Sertoli cell-only syndrome. There are reports of progressive\\nimpairment of spermatogenesis over time in patient with AZFc deletion. The fourth AZFd region,\\nwhich was earlier proposed, does not exist based on the Y chromosome sequencing. There are many\\ncandidate genes within the deleted regions that are responsible for impaired spermatogenesis. The\\nextensively studied genes are DAZ on AZFc region, RBMY1A1 on AZFb region, and USP9Y, DBY,\\nand UTY on AZFa region. Because the deleted genes are expressed mainly in testes, men carrying the\\ndeletions have no abnormalities other than spermatogenic failure.\\nThe incidence of Yq microdeletions in infertile men varies from 1–55% depending on study design.\\nThe most frequently deleted region is AZFc (~60%), whereas the deletion of the AZFa region is\\nextremely rare (5%). The identification of Yq microdeletion has a prognostic value for the chance of\\nsuccessful testicular sperm retrieval. Men with complete deletion of AZFa and AZFb regions have\\nalmost no chance of having sperm recovered from surgical testicular sperm retrieval procedure, and\\nno treatment is presently available for their fertility problem besides the use of donor sperm.\\nIn the past, the majority of cases of Yq microdeletions have been de novo in infertile men during\\nembryogenesis or from meiotic error in the germline of the fertile father.

Ovarian Agenesis–Dysgenesis\\nIn 1938, Turner described 7 girls 15–23 years of age with sexual infantilism, webbing of the neck,\\ncubitus valgus, and retardation of growth. A survey of the literature indicates that “Turner’s\\nsyndrome” means different things to different writers. After the later discovery that ovarian streaks\\nare characteristically associated with the clinical entity described by Turner, “ovarian agenesis”\\nbecame a synonym for Turner’s syndrome. After discovery of the absence of the X-chromatin body in\\nsuch patients, the term ovarian agenesis gave way to “gonadal dysgenesis,” “gonadal agenesis,” or\\n“gonadal aplasia.”\\nMeanwhile, some patients with the genital characteristics mentioned previously were shown to\\nhave a normally positive X-chromatin count. Furthermore, a variety of sex chromosome complements\\nhave been found in connection with streak gonads. As if these contradictions were not perplexing\\nenough, it has been noted that streaks are by no means confined to patients with Turner’s original\\ntetrad of infantilism, webbing of the neck, cubitus valgus, and retardation of growth but may be\\npresent in girls with sexual infantilism only. Since Turner’s original description, a host of additional\\nsomatic anomalies (varying in frequency) have been associated with his original clinical picture; these\\ninclude shield chest, overweight, high palate, micrognathia, epicanthal folds, low-set ears, hypoplasia\\nof nails, osteoporosis, pigmented moles, hypertension, lymphedema, cutis laxa, keloids, coarctation of\\nthe aorta, mental retardation, intestinal telangiectasia, and deafness.\\nFor our purposes, the eponym Turner’s syndrome will be used to indicate sexual infantilism with\\novarian streaks, short stature, and 2 or more of the somatic anomalies mentioned earlier. In this\\ncontext, terms such as ovarian agenesis, gonadal agenesis, and gonadal dysgenesis lose their clinical\\nsignificance and become merely descriptions of the gonadal development of the person. At least 21\\nsex chromosome complements have been associated with streak gonads (\\nFig. 3–6\\n), but only about 9\\nsex chromosome complements have been associated with Turner’s syndrome.

Klinefelter’s Syndrome\\nThis condition, first described in 1942 by Klinefelter, Reifenstein, and Albright, occurs only in\\napparent males. As originally described, it is characterized by small testes, azoospermia,\\ngynecomastia, relatively normal external genitalia, and otherwise average somatic development. High\\nlevels of gonadotropin in urine or serum are characteristic.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms & Signs\\nBy definition, this syndrome applies only to persons reared as males. The disease is not recognizable\\nbefore puberty except by routine screening of newborn infants. Most patients come under observation\\nat 16–40 years of age.\\nSomatic development during infancy and childhood may be normal. Growth and muscular\\ndevelopment may also be within normal limits. Most patients have a normal general appearance and\\nno complaints referable to this abnormality, which is often discovered during the course of a routine\\nphysical examination or an infertility study.\\nIn the original publication by Klinefelter and coworkers, gynecomastia was considered an essential\\npart of the syndrome. Since then, however, cases without gynecomastia have been reported.\\nThe external genitalia are perfectly formed and in most patients are quite well developed. Erection\\nand intercourse usually are satisfactory.\\nThere is no history of delayed descent of the testes in typical cases, and the testes are in the\\nscrotum. Neither is there any history of testicular trauma or disease. Although a history of mumps\\norchitis is occasionally elicited, this disease has not been correlated with the syndrome. However, the\\ntestes are often very small in contrast to the rest of the genitalia (about 1.5 × 1.5 cm).\\nPsychological symptoms are often present. Most studies of this syndrome have been performed in\\npsychiatric institutions. The seriousness of the psychological disturbance seems to be partly related to\\nthe number of extra X chromosomes—eg, it is estimated that about one-fourth of XXY patients have\\nsome degree of mental retardation.\\nB. Laboratory Findings\\nOne of the extremely important clinical features of Klinefelter’s syndrome is the excessive amount of\\npituitary gonadotropin found in either urine or serum assay.\\nThe urinary excretion of neutral 17-ketosteroids varies from relatively normal to definitely\\nsubnormal levels.

The nuclear sex\\nanomaly reflects a basic genetic abnormality in sex chromosome constitution. All cases studied have\\nhad at least 2 X chromosomes and 1 Y chromosome. The most common abnormality in the sex\\nchromosome constitution is XXY, but the literature also records XXXY, XXYY, XXXXY, and\\nXXXYY, and mosaics of XX/XXY, XY/XXY, XY/XXXY, and XXXY/XXXXY. In all examples\\nexcept the XX/XXY mosaic, a Y chromosome is present in all cells. From these patterns, it is obvious\\nthat the Y chromosome has a very strong testis-forming impulse, which can operate in spite of the\\npresence of as many as 4 X chromosomes.\\nThus, patients with Klinefelter’s syndrome will have not only a positive X-chromatin body but also\\na positive Y-chromatin body.\\nThe abnormal sex chromosome constitution causes differentiation of an abnormal testis, leading to\\ntesticular failure in adulthood. At birth or before puberty, such testes show a marked deficiency or\\nabsence of germinal cells.\\nBy means of nursery screening, the frequency of males with positive X-chromatin bodies has been\\nestimated to be 2.65 per 1000 live male births.\\nTreatment\\nThere is no treatment for the 2 principal complaints of these patients: infertility and gynecomastia. No\\npituitary preparation has been effective in the regeneration of the hyalinized tubular epithelium or the\\nstimulation of gametogenesis. Furthermore, no hormone regimen is effective in treating the breast\\nhypertrophy. When the breasts are a formidable psychological problem, surgical removal may be a\\nsatisfactory procedure. In patients who have clinical symptoms of hypoleydigism, substitution therapy\\nwith testosterone is an important physiologic and psychological aid. Donor sperm may be offered for\\ntreatment of infertility.\\n4. Double-X Males\\nA few cases of adult males with a slightly hypoplastic penis and very small testes but no other\\nindication of abnormal sexual development have been reported. These males are sterile. Unlike those\\nwith Klinefelter’s syndrome, they do not have abnormal breast development. They are clinically very\\nsimilar to patients with Del Castillo’s syndrome (testicular dysgenesis). Nevertheless, the XX males\\nhave a positive sex chromatin and a normal female karyotype.

Multiple-X Syndromes\\nThe finding of more than 1 X-chromatin body in a cell indicates the presence of more than 2 X\\nchromosomes in that particular cell. In many patients, such a finding is associated with mosaicism,\\nand the clinical picture is controlled by this fact—eg, if 1 of the strains of the mosaicism is 45,X,\\ngonadal agenesis is likely to occur. There also are persons who do not seem to have mosaicism but do\\nhave an abnormal number of X chromosomes in all cells.

Nevertheless, the triplo-X condition seems selective for normal ova and zygotes.\\nThe diagnosis of this syndrome is made by identifying a high percentage of cells with double X-\\nchromatin bodies in the buccal smear and by finding 47 chromosomes with a karyotype showing an\\nextra X chromosome in all cells cultured from the peripheral blood. It should be noted that in the\\nexamination of the buccal smear, some cells have a single X-chromatin body. Hence, based on the\\nchromatin examination, one might suspect XX/XXX mosaicism. Actually, in triplo-X patients, only a\\nsingle type of cell can be demonstrated in cultures of cells from the peripheral blood. The absence of\\nthe second X-chromatin body in some of the somatic cells may result from the time of examination of\\nthe cell (during interphase) and from the spatial orientation, which could have prevented visualization\\nof the 2 X-chromatin bodies (adjacent to the nuclear membrane). In this syndrome, the number of\\ncells containing either 1 or 2 X-chromatin bodies is very high—at least 60–80%, as compared with an\\nupper limit of about 40% in normal females.\\n6.

In the newborn, the latter is very rare, but in older children and adults with\\nelevated 17-ketosteroids, the possibility of tumor must be considered. One of the most satisfactory\\nmethods of making this different diagnosis is to attempt to suppress the excess androgens by\\nadministration of dexamethasone. In an adult or an older child, a suitable test dose of dexamethasone\\nis 1.25 mg/45 kg (100 lb) body weight, given orally for 7 consecutive days. In congenital adrenal\\nhyperplasia, there should be suppression of the urinary 17-ketosteroids on the seventh day of the test\\nto less than 1 mg/24 h; in the presence of tumor, either there will be no effect or the 17-ketosteroid\\nlevels will rise.\\nDetermination of urinary dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or serum dehydroepiandrosterone\\nsulfate (DHEAS) levels can also be helpful in differentiating congenital adrenal hyperplasia from an\\nadrenal tumor. Levels in patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia may be up to double the normal\\namount, whereas an adrenal tumor is usually associated with levels that are much higher than double\\nthe normal level.\\nDetermination of the serum sodium and potassium levels and CO\\n2\\n-combining power is also\\nimportant to ascertain whether electrolyte balance is seriously disturbed.\\nTreatment\\nThe treatment of female hermaphroditism due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia is partly medical and\\npartly surgical. Originally, cortisone was administered; today, it is known that various cortisone\\nderivatives are at least as effective. It is most satisfactory to begin treatment with relatively large\\ndoses of hydrocortisone divided in 3 doses orally for 7–10 days to obtain rapid suppression of adrenal\\nactivity. In young infants, the initial dose is about 25 mg/d; in older patients, 100 mg/d. After the\\noutput of 17-ketosteroids has decreased to a lower level, the dose should be reduced to the minimum\\namount required to maintain adequate suppression. This requires repeated measurements of plasma\\n17α-hydroxyprogesterone in order to individualize the dose.\\nIt has been found that even with suppression of the urinary 17-ketosteroids to normal levels, the\\nmore sensitive serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone level may still be elevated.

This period of final maturation is known\\nas adolescence. It is often called puberty, although strictly defined, puberty is the period when the\\nendocrine and gametogenic functions of the gonads first develop to the point where reproduction is\\npossible.\\nAfter sexual maturity, there are regular periodic changes of the adult female reproductive system,\\neach in preparation for pregnancy. The cyclic changes are primarily divided into the ovarian and\\nuterine cycle, though changes can also be seen in the uterine cervix, vagina, and breasts. Control of the\\ncycle is exerted through the regulation of hypothalamic, pituitary, and ovarian hormones.\\nWith advancing age, these cycles become irregular and eventually cease in the period known as\\nmenopause. The ovarian follicles are less responsive to central regulation, and there is an acute\\ndecrease in estrogen levels, which may lead to vasomotor symptoms, labile mood, and many changes\\nin the female reproductive tract.\\nPUBERTY\\nThe age at the time of puberty is variable. In Europe and the United States, it has been declining at the\\nrate of 1–3 months per decade for more than 175 years. In the United States in recent years, puberty\\nhas generally been occurring between the ages of 8 and 13 in girls and 9 and 14 in boys depending on\\nethnic background.\\nAnother event that occurs in humans at the time of puberty is an increase in the secretion of adrenal\\nandrogens (\\nFig. 4–1\\n). The onset of this increase is called \\nadrenarche\\n. It typically happens in males\\nand females before the onset of puberty occurring at age 8–10 years in girls and 10–12 years in boys.\\nDehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) values peak at about 25 years of age and are slightly higher in boys.\\nThey then decline slowly to low values after the age of 60.'),\n",

Adrenarche is probably due to a rise in\\nthe lyase activity of a 17α-hydroxylase.

New York, NY:\\nBlackwell; 1962.)\\nControl of the Onset of Puberty\\nIn general, many factors can influence the timing of the initiation of puberty including general health,\\ngenetic influences, nutrition, and exercise. However, a neural mechanism is thought to be\\npredominantly responsible for the onset of puberty. It depends on normal functioning of the\\nhypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. In children, the gonads can be stimulated by gonadotropins, the\\npituitary contains gonadotropins, and the hypothalamus contains gonadotropin-releasing hormone\\n(GnRH). However, the gonadotropins are not secreted. In immature monkeys, normal menstrual cycles\\ncan be brought on by pulsatile injection of GnRH, and the cycles persist as long as the pulsatile\\ninjection is continued. In addition, GnRH is secreted in a pulsatile fashion in adults. Thus, it seems\\nclear that during the period from birth \\nto puberty, a neural mechanism is operating to prevent the\\nnormal pulsatile release of GnRH. The nature of the mechanism inhibiting the GnRH pulse generator\\nis unknown. Several theories have been suggested about this mechanism, including a recent study\\ninvolving humans and mice, providing evidence that GPR54, a gene for a G protein–coupled receptor,\\nis involved in the regulation of the processing or secretion of GnRH by the hypothalamus.\\nRelation to Leptin\\nIt has been argued for some time that normally a critical body weight must be reached for puberty to\\noccur. Thus, for example, young women who engage in strenuous athletics lose weight and stop\\nmenstruating. The same is seen in girls with anorexia nervosa. If these girls start to eat and gain\\nweight, they menstruate again, ie, they “go back through puberty.” It now appears that leptin, the\\nsatiety-producing hormone secreted by fat cells, may be the link between body weight and puberty.\\nLeptin treatment has been shown to induce precocious puberty in immature female mice. However,\\nmore recent studies have suggested leptin to have a more permissive role for the onset of puberty\\nrather than being a trigger. Observations of recombinant leptin administration in older, but not\\nyounger, children with leptin deficiency resulted in increased gonadotropin pulsatility. The role of\\nleptin in the control of pubarche remains to be determined.\\nSexual Precocity\\nSexual precocity is pubertal development occurring before the age of 8 years in girls, and before the\\nage of 9 years in boys. The major causes of precocious sexual development in humans are listed in\\nTable 4–1\\n. Early development of secondary sexual characteristics without gametogenesis is caused by\\nabnormal exposure of immature males to androgen or females to estrogen. This syndrome should be\\ncalled \\nprecocious pseudopuberty\\n to distinguish it from true precocious puberty due to an early, but\\notherwise normal pubertal pattern of gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary (\\nFig. 4–3\\n).'),\n",

Pineal tumors are\\nsometimes associated with precocious puberty, but there is evidence that these tumors are related only\\nwhen there is secondary damage to the hypothalamus. Precocity due to this and other forms of\\nhypothalamic damage probably occurs with equal frequency in both sexes, although the constitutional\\nform of precocious puberty is more common in girls. In addition, it has now been proven that\\nprecocious gametogenesis and steroidogenesis can occur without the pubertal pattern of gonadotropin\\nsecretion (gonadotropin-independent precocity). At least in some cases of the condition, the\\nsensitivity of luteinizing hormone (LH) receptors to gonadotropins is increased because of an\\nactivating mutation in the G protein that couples receptors to adenylyl cyclase.\\nRecent observational studies have proposed a link between low birth weight, increased weight gain\\nduring childhood, changes in insulin sensitivity, and subsequent hormonal changes, such as early\\npubarche. Although the association remains speculative, these studies suggest a programmed\\nadaptation to improved postnatal nutritional status triggering a pathway of rapid growth and secondary\\nsexual development.\\nDelayed or Absent Puberty\\nThe normal variation in the age at which adolescent changes occur is so wide that puberty cannot be\\nconsidered to be pathologically delayed until the absence of secondary sexual development by age 14\\nin girls or until the failure of menarche by the age of 17. Failure of maturation due to\\npanhypopituitarism is associated with dwarfing and evidence of other endocrine abnormalities.\\nPatients with the XO chromosomal pattern and gonadal dysgenesis are also dwarfed. In some\\nindividuals, puberty is delayed and menarche does not occur (primary amenorrhea), even though the\\ngonads are present and other endocrine functions are normal.\\nREPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION AFTER SEXUAL MATURITY\\nMenstrual Cycle\\nThe anatomy of the reproductive system of adult women is described in \\nChapter 1\\n. Unlike the\\nreproductive system of men, this system shows regular cyclic changes that teleologically may be\\nregarded as periodic preparation for fertilization and pregnancy. In primates, the cycle is a \\nmenstrual\\ncycle\\n, and its most conspicuous feature is the cyclic vaginal bleeding that occurs with shedding of the\\nuterine mucosa (\\nmenstruation\\n). The length of the cycle is notoriously variable, but the average figure\\nis 28 days from the start of one menstrual period to the start of the next. By common usage, the days\\nof the cycle are identified by number, starting with the first day of menstruation.\\nOvarian Cycle\\nFrom the time of birth, there are many \\nprimordial follicles\\n under the ovarian capsule. Each contains\\nan immature ovum (\\nFig. 4–4\\n). At the start of each cycle, several of these follicles enlarge and a cavity\\nforms around the ovum (antrum formation). This cavity is filled with follicular fluid. In humans, 1 of\\nthe follicles in 1 ovary starts to grow rapidly on about the sixth day and becomes the \\ndominant\\nfollicle\\n. The others regress, forming \\natretic follicles\\n. It is not known how 1 follicle is singled out for\\ndevelopment during this \\nfollicular phase\\n of the menstrual cycle, but it seems to be related to the\\nfollicle’s ability to produce estrogen, which is necessary for final maturation. The secretion of\\nestrogen, in animal models, has been demonstrated even before the dominant follicle has emerged as\\nmorphologically dominant.

The interstitial cell mass is not prominent in primates.\\nAt about the 14th day of the cycle, the distended follicle ruptures, and the ovum is extruded into the\\nabdominal cavity. This is the process of \\novulation\\n. The ovum is picked up by the fimbriated ends of\\nthe uterine tubes (oviducts) and transported to the uterus. Unless fertilization occurs, the ovum\\ndegenerates or passes on through the uterus and out of the vagina.\\nThe follicle that ruptures at the time of ovulation promptly fills with blood, forming what is\\nsometimes called a \\ncorpus hemorrhagicum\\n. Minor bleeding from the follicle into the abdominal\\ncavity may cause peritoneal irritation and fleeting lower abdominal pain (“mittelschmerz”). The\\ngranulosa and theca cells of the follicle lining promptly begin to proliferate, and the clotted blood is\\nrapidly replaced with yellowish, lipid-rich \\nluteal cells\\n, forming the \\ncorpus luteum\\n. This is the \\nluteal\\nphase\\n of the menstrual cycle, during which the luteal cells secrete estrogen and progesterone. Growth\\nof the corpus luteum depends on its developing an adequate blood supply. There is evidence that\\nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is essential for this process through regulation by the\\ntranscription factor, HIF-1α, under hypoxic conditions or by gonadotropin-stimulated conditions. If\\npregnancy occurs, the corpus luteum persists, and there are usually no more menstrual cycles until\\nafter delivery. If there is no pregnancy, the corpus luteum begins to degenerate about 4 days before the\\nnext menses (day 24 of the cycle) and is eventually replaced by fibrous tissue, forming a \\ncorpus\\nalbicans\\n.\\nIn humans, no new ova are formed after birth. During fetal development, the ovaries contain over 7\\nmillion germ cells; however, many undergo involution before birth, and others are lost after birth. At\\nthe time of birth, there are approximately 2 million primordial follicles containing ova, but\\napproximately 50% of these are atretic. The remaining million ova undergo the first meiotic division\\nat this time and arrest in prophase until adulthood. Atresia continues during development, and the\\nnumber of ova in both the ovaries at the time of puberty is less than 300,000 (\\nFig. 4–5\\n). Normally,\\nonly 1 of these ova per cycle (or about 400–500 in the course of a normal reproductive life) is\\nstimulated to mature; the remainder degenerate. Just before ovulation, the first meiotic division is\\ncompleted. One of the daughter cells, the \\nsecondary oocyte\\n, receives most of the cytoplasm, \\nwhile the\\nother, the \\nfirst polar body\\n, fragments and disappears.

At that time, the \\nsecond polar body\\n is cast off, and the fertilized ovum\\nproceeds to form a new individual.'),\n",

By\\nthe end of each menstrual period, all but the deep layer of the endometrium has sloughed. Under the\\ninfluence of estrogen secreted from the developing follicles, the endometrium regenerates from the\\ndeep layer and increases rapidly in thickness during the period from the fifth to 16th days of the\\nmenstrual cycle. As the thickness increases, the uterine glands are drawn out so that they lengthen\\n(\\nFig. 4–6\\n), but they do not become convoluted or secrete to any degree. These endometrial changes are\\ncalled proliferative, and this part of the menstrual cycle is sometimes called the \\nproliferative phase\\n.\\nIt is also called the preovulatory or follicular phase of the cycle. After ovulation, the endometrium\\nbecomes more highly vascularized and slightly edematous under the influence of estrogen and\\nprogesterone from the corpus luteum.

(Reproduced, with permission,\\nfrom Ganong WF. \\nReview of Medical Physiology\\n. 22nd ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2005.)\\nThe endometrium is supplied by 2 types of arteries. The superficial two-thirds of the endometrium,\\nthe stratum functionale, is shed during menstruation and is supplied by the long, coiled spiral arteries.\\nThe deep layer, which is not shed, is called the stratum basale and is supplied by short, straight basilar\\narteries.\\nWhen the corpus luteum regresses, hormonal support for the endometrium is withdrawn, causing\\nvascular spasms in the spiral artery, ultimately leading to endometrial ischemia. The endometrium\\nbecomes thinner, which adds to the coiling of the spiral arteries. Leukocyte infiltration into the\\nendometrial stroma initiates the breakdown of the extracellular matrix in the functionalis layer. Foci\\nof necrosis appear in the endometrium and walls of the spiral arteries, which coalesce and lead to\\nspotty hemorrhages that become confluent and ultimately produce menstrual flow.\\nSpiral artery vasospasm serves to limit blood loss during menstruation and probably is produced by\\nlocally released prostaglandins. There are large quantities of prostaglandins in the secretory\\nendometrium and in menstrual blood. Infusions of prostaglandin F\\n2a\\n (PGF\\n2a\\n) produce endometrial\\nnecrosis and bleeding. One theory of the onset of menstruation holds that in necrotic endometrial\\ncells, lysosomal membranes break down and release proteolytic enzymes that foster the formation of\\nprostaglandins from cellular phospholipids while promoting further local tissue destruction.\\nFrom the point of view of endometrial function, the proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle\\nrepresents the restoration of the epithelium from the preceding menstruation, while the secretory\\nphase represents the preparation of the uterus for implantation of the fertilized ovum.

The variations seen in the length of the\\nmenstrual cycle are mostly due to variations in the length of the proliferative phase. When\\nfertilization fails to occur during the secretory phase, the endometrium is shed, and a new cycle\\nbegins.\\nNormal Menstruation\\nMenstrual blood is predominantly arterial, with only 25% of the blood being of venous origin. It\\ncontains tissue debris, prostaglandins, and relatively large amounts of fibrinolysin from the\\nendometrial tissue. The fibrinolysin lyses clots, so menstrual blood does not normally contain clots\\nunless the flow is excessive.\\nThe usual duration of the menstrual cycle is 3–5 days, but flow as short as 1 day and as long as 8\\ndays can occur in normal women. The average amount of blood loss is 30 mL but normally may range\\nfrom slight spotting to 80 mL. Loss of more than 80 mL is abnormal. Obviously, the amount of flow\\ncan be affected by various factors, including not only the thickness of the endometrium, but also the\\nmedications and diseases that affect clotting mechanisms. After menstruation, the endometrium\\nregenerates from the stratum basale.\\nAnovulatory Cycles\\nIn some instances, ovulation fails to occur during the menstrual cycle. Such anovulatory cycles are\\ncommon for the first 12–18 months after menarche and again before the onset of menopause. When\\novulation does not occur, no corpus luteum is formed, and the effects of progesterone on the\\nendometrium are absent. Estrogens continue to \\ncause growth, however, and the proliferative\\nendometrium becomes thick enough to break down and begin to slough. The time it takes for bleeding\\nto occur is variable, but it usually occurs less than 28 days from the last menstrual period. The flow is\\nalso variable and ranges from scanty to relatively profuse.\\nCyclic Changes in the Uterine Cervix\\nAlthough it is contiguous with the body of the uterus, the cervix of the uterus is different in a number\\nof ways. The mucosa of the uterine cervix does not undergo cyclic desquamation, but there are regular\\nchanges in the cervical mucus. Estrogen makes the mucus much thinner and more alkaline, changes\\nthat promote the survival and transport of sperm. Progesterone makes it thick, tenacious, and cellular.\\nThe mucus is thinnest at the time of ovulation, and its elasticity, or \\nspinnbarkeit\\n, increases so that by\\nmidcycle a drop can be stretched into a long, thin thread that may be 8–12 cm or more in length.

Under the influence of progesterone, a thick\\nmucus is secreted, and the epithelium proliferates and becomes infiltrated with leukocytes. The cyclic\\nchanges in the vaginal smear in rats are particularly well known. The changes in humans and other\\nspecies are similar but unfortunately not so clear-cut. However, the increase in cornified epithelial\\ncells is apparent when a vaginal smear from an adult woman in the follicular phase of the menstrual\\ncycle is compared, for example, with a smear taken from a prepubescent female.\\nCyclic Changes in the Breasts\\nAlthough lactation normally does not occur until the end of pregnancy, there are cyclic changes in the\\nbreasts during the menstrual cycle. Estrogens cause proliferation of mammary ducts, whereas\\nprogesterone causes growth of lobules and alveoli (see Actions of Progesterone). The breast swelling,\\ntenderness, and pain experienced by many women during the 10 days preceding menstruation probably\\nare due to distention of the ducts, hyperemia, and edema of the interstitial tissue of the breasts.

This change in body temperature (see\\nIndicators of Ovulation) probably is due to the thermogenic effect of progesterone.\\nChanges During Sexual Intercourse\\nDuring sexual excitation, the vaginal walls become moist as a result of transudation of fluid through\\nthe mucus membrane. A lubricating mucus is secreted by the vestibular glands. The upper part of the\\nvagina is sensitive to stretch, while tactile stimulation from the labia minora and clitoris adds to the\\nsexual excitement. The stimuli are reinforced by tactile stimuli from the breasts and, as in men, by\\nvisual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli. Eventually, the crescendo or climax known as orgasm may be\\nreached. During orgasm, there are autonomically mediated rhythmic contractions of the vaginal wall.\\nImpulses also travel via the pudendal nerves and produce rhythmic contractions of the\\nbulbocavernosus and ischiocavernosus muscles. The vaginal contractions may aid in the transport of\\nspermatozoa but are not essential for it, as fertilization of the ovum is not dependent on orgasm.\\nIndicators of Ovulation\\nKnowing when during the menstrual cycle ovulation occurs is important in increasing fertility or,\\nconversely, \\nin contraception. A convenient, but retrospective, indicator of the time of ovulation is a\\nrise in the basal body temperature (\\nFig. 4–8\\n). Accurate temperatures can be obtained by using a\\nthermometer that is able to measure temperature precisely between 96 and 100°F. The woman should\\ntake her temperature orally, vaginally, or rectally in the morning before getting out of bed. The cause\\nof temperature change at the time of ovulation is unknown but probably is due to the increase in\\nprogesterone secretion, as progesterone is thermogenic. A rise in urinary LH occurs during the rise in\\ncirculating LH that causes ovulation. This increase can be measured and used as another indicator of\\novulation. Kits using dipsticks or simple color tests for detection of urinary LH are available for home\\nuse.\\nOvulation normally occurs about 9 hours after the peak of the LH surge at midcycle (\\nFig. 4–8\\n). The\\novum lives approximately 72 hours after it is extruded from the follicle but probably is fertilizable for\\nless than half this time. In a study of the relationship of isolated intercourse to pregnancy, 36% of\\nwomen had a detected pregnancy following intercourse on the day of ovulation, but with intercourse\\non days after ovulation, the percentage was zero. Isolated intercourse of the first and second days\\nbefore ovulation led to pregnancy in about 36% of the women. A few pregnancies resulted from\\nisolated intercourse on day 3, 4, or 5 before ovulation, although the percentage was much lower, ie,\\n8% on day 5 before ovulation. Thus, some sperm can survive in the female genital tract and produce\\nfertilization for up to 120 hours before ovulation, but the most fertile period is clearly the 48 hours\\nbefore ovulation. However, for those interested in the “rhythm method” of contraception, if should be\\nnoted that there are rare but documented cases of pregnancy resulting from isolated coitus on every\\nday of the cycle.'),\n",

The liver palms, spider angiomas, and\\nslight breast enlargement seen in advanced liver disease are due to increased circulating estrogens.\\nThe increase appears to be due to decreased hepatic metabolism of androstenedione, making more of\\nthis androgen available for conversion to estrogens.\\nEstrogens have a significant plasma cholesterol-lowering action. They produce vasodilatation and\\ninhibit vascular smooth muscle proliferation, possibly by increasing the local production of nitric\\noxide (NO). Estrogen has also been shown to prevent expression of factors important in the initiation\\nof atherosclerosis.

Large doses of oral estrogen also promote thrombosis, apparently because the high\\nconcentrations of estrogen that reach the liver in the portal blood alter hepatic production of clotting\\nfactors.\\nMechanism of Action\\nThe 2 principal types of nuclear estrogen receptors are estrogen receptor-α (ER-α), which is encoded\\nby a gene on chromosome 6, and estrogen receptor-β (ER-β), which is encoded by a gene on\\nchromosome 14. Both are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, which includes receptors for\\nmany different steroids. After binding estrogen, the nuclear receptors dimerize and bind to DNA,\\naltering its transcription (\\nFig. 4–12\\n). Some tissues contain one type or the other, but there is also\\noverlap, with some tissues containing both ER-α and ER-β. ER-α is found primarily in the uterus,\\nkidneys, liver, and heart; whereas ER-β is found primarily in the ovaries, prostate, lung,\\ngastrointestinal tract, hemopoietic system, and central nervous system. The receptors also form\\nheterodimers, with ER-α binding to ER-β. Male and female mice in which the gene for ER-α has been\\nknocked out are sterile, develop osteoporosis, and continue to grow because their epiphyses do not\\nclose. ER-β female knockouts are infertile, but ER-β male knockouts are fertile even though they have\\nhyperplastic prostates and loss of fat. Thus, the actions of the estrogen receptors are complex,\\nmultiple, and varied. However, this is not surprising because it is now known that both receptors exist\\nin various isoforms and, like thyroid receptors, can bind to various activating and stimulating factors.'),\n",

It is unlikely that there is an additional separate follicle-stimulating hormone-\\nreleasing hormone (FRH).\\nGnRH is normally secreted in episodic bursts (\\ncirchoral secretion\\n).

This\\nunresponsiveness is associated with and is probably caused by a decline in the number of primordial\\nfollicles (\\nFig. 4–5\\n).

They are frequently referred to as\\nmodified sweat glands. Each breast lies on the superior aspect of the chest wall. In women, the breasts\\nare the organs of lactation, whereas in men, the breasts are normally functionless and undeveloped.\\nHISTOLOGY\\nThe adult female breast contains glandular and ductal elements, stroma consisting of fibrous tissue\\nthat binds the individual lobes together and adipose tissue within and between the lobes.\\nEach breast consists of 12–20 conical lobes. The base of each lobe is in close proximity to the ribs.\\nThe apex, which contains the major excretory duct of the lobe, is deep to the areola and nipple. In turn,\\neach lobe consists of a group of lobules. The lobules have several lactiferous ducts, which unite to\\nform a major duct that drains the lobes as they course toward the nipple–areolar complex. Each of the\\nmajor ducts widens to form an ampulla as they travel toward the areola and then narrow at its\\nindividual opening in the nipple. The lobules are held in place by a meshwork of loose, fatty areolar\\ntissue. The fatty tissue increases toward the periphery of the lobule and gives the breast its bulk and\\nhemispheric shape.\\nApproximately 80–85% of the normal breast is adipose tissue. The breast tissues are joined to the\\noverlying skin and subcutaneous tissue by fibrous strands.\\nIn the nonpregnant, nonlactating breast, the alveoli are small and tightly packed. During pregnancy,\\nthe alveoli hypertrophy, and their lining cells proliferate in number. During lactation, the alveolar\\ncells secrete proteins and lipids, which comprise breast milk.\\nThe deep surface of the breast lies on the fascia that covers the chest muscles. The fascial stroma,\\nderived from the superficial fascia of the chest wall, is condensed into multiple bands that run from\\nthe breast into the subcutaneous tissues and the corium of the skin overlying the breast. These fascial\\nbands—Cooper’s ligaments—support the breast in its upright position on the chest wall. These bands\\nmay be distorted by a tumor, resulting in pathologic skin dimpling.\\nHISTOLOGIC CHANGES IN THE FEMALE BREAST DURING THE LIFE SPAN\\nIn response to multiglandular stimulation during puberty, the female breast starts to enlarge and\\neventually assumes its conical or spherical shape. Growth is the result of an increase in acinar tissue,\\nductal size and branching, and deposits of adipose, the main factor in breast enlargement. Also during\\npuberty, the nipple and areola enlarge. Smooth muscle fibers surround the base of the nipple, and the\\nnipple becomes more sensitive to touch.\\nOnce menses is established, the breast undergoes a periodic premenstrual phase during which the'),\n",

Many women have breast tenderness during this phase of the menstrual cycle. Menstrual\\nbleeding is followed by a postmenstrual phase, characterized by a decrease in size and turgor,\\nreduction in the number and size of the breast acini, and a decrease in diameter of the lactiferous\\nducts. Cyclic hormonal influences to the breast are quite variable.\\nIn response to progesterone during pregnancy, breast size and turgidity increase considerably.\\nThese changes are accompanied by deepening pigmentation of the nipple–areolar complex, nipple\\nenlargement, areolar widening, and an increase in the number and size of the lubricating glands in the\\nareola. The breast ductal system branches markedly, and the individual ducts widen. The acini\\nincrease in number and size. In late pregnancy, the fatty tissues of the breasts are almost completely\\nreplaced by cellular breast parenchyma. After delivery with the rapid drop in progesterone \\nand\\nestrogen levels, the breasts, now fully mature, start to secrete milk. With cessation of nursing or\\nadministration of estrogens, which inhibit lactation, the breast rapidly returns to its prepregnancy\\nstate, with marked diminution of cellular elements and an increase in adipose deposits.\\nFollowing menopause, which typically occurs during the fifth decade of life, the breast undergoes a\\ngradual process of atrophy and involution. There is a decrease in the number and size of acinar and\\nductal elements, so that the breast tissue regresses to an almost infantile state. Adipose tissue may or\\nmay not atrophy, with disappearance of the parenchymal elements.\\nGROSS ANATOMY (\\nFig. 5–1\\n)\\nThe adult female breast mound characteristically forms a near hemispheric contour on each side of the\\nchest wall, usually extending from just below the level of the second rib inferiorly to the sixth or\\nseventh rib. The breast mound is usually situated between the lateral sternal border and the anterior\\naxillary fold. The breast tissue extends over a larger anatomic area than the more obvious breast\\nmound. The superior portion of the breast tissue emerges gradually from the chest wall inferior to the\\nclavicle, whereas the lateral and inferior borders are better defined. The major portion of the breast\\ntissue is located superficial to the pectoralis major muscle and projects laterally and ventrally toward\\nthe tail of Spence. Smaller portions of breast tissue extend laterally and inferiorly to lie superficial to\\nthe serratus anterior and external oblique muscles and as far caudad as the rectus abdominis. The tail\\nof Spence is a triangular tongue-shaped portion of breast tissue that extends superiorly and laterally\\ntoward the axilla, perforating the deep axillary fascia, and enters the axilla, where it terminates in\\nclose proximity to the axillary lymph nodes and vessels as well as the axillary blood vessels and\\nnerves.'),\n",

Sagittal section of mammary gland.\\nThe Nipple & Areola\\nThe areola is a circular pigmented zone 2–6 cm in diameter at the tip of the breast. Its color varies\\nfrom pale pink to deep brown depending on age, parity, and skin pigmentation. The skin of the areola\\ncontains multiple small, elevated nodules beneath which are located the sebaceous glands of\\nMontgomery. The glands are responsible for lubrication of the nipple and help prevent cracks and\\nfissures in the nipple–areolar complex that occur during breastfeeding. During the third trimester of\\npregnancy, the sebaceous glands of Montgomery markedly hypertrophy.\\nA circular smooth muscle band surrounds the base of the nipple. Longitudinal smooth muscle\\nfibers branch out from this ring of circular smooth muscle to encircle the lactiferous ducts as they\\nconverge toward the nipple. The many small punctate openings at the superior aspect of the nipple\\nrepresent the terminals of the major lactiferous ducts.

Arteries (\\nFig. 5–2\\n)\\nThe breast has a rich blood supply with multiple arteries and veins. Perforating branches from the\\ninternal thoracic/mammary artery that penetrate the second to the fifth intercostal interspaces supply\\nblood to the medial half of the breast. These arteries perforate the intercostal muscles and the anterior\\nintercostal membrane to supply both the breast and the pectoralis major and minor muscles. During\\npregnancy, and not infrequently in advanced breast disease, the intercostal perforators may enlarge\\nfrom engorgement. Small branches from the anterior intercostal arteries also supply the medial aspect\\nof the breast. Laterally, the pectoral branch of the thoracoacromial branch of the axillary artery and\\nthe external mammary branch of the lateral thoracic artery, which also is a branch of the second\\nsegment of the axillary artery, supply the breast. The external mammary artery passes along the \\nlateral\\nfree edge of the pectoralis major muscle to reach the lateral half of the breast. The artery usually is\\nlocated medial to the long thoracic nerve.'),\n",

Veins\\nVenous return from the breast closely follows the routes of the arterial system. Blood returns to the\\nsuperior vena cava via the axillary and internal thoracic veins. It also returns via the vertebral venous\\nplexuses, which are fed by the intercostal and azygos veins. Through the azygos veins, there is also\\nsome minor flow into the portal system. A rich anastomotic plexus of superficial breast veins is\\nlocated in the subareolar region. In thin-skinned, fair individuals, these veins are normally visible, and\\nthey are almost always visible during pregnancy.

Lymphatics of the breast and axilla.\\nLymphatic drainage in the breast may be divided into 2 main categories: superficial (including\\ncutaneous) drainage and deep parenchymatous drainage.\\n1. Superficial drainage\\n—A large lymphatic plexus exists in the subcutaneous tissues of the breast\\ndeep to the nipple–areolar complex. This plexus drains the areola and nipple regions, including the\\ncutaneous and subcutaneous tissues adjacent to the nipple–areolar complex. In addition, the\\nsuperficial plexus drains the deep central parenchymatous region of the breast.\\n2. Deep parenchymatous drainage\\n—The deep parenchymatous lymph vessels drain the remainder of\\nthe breast as well as some portion of the skin and subcutaneous tissues of the nipple–areolar complex\\nnot served by the superficial plexus. Small periductal and periacinal lymph vessels collect\\nparenchymal lymph and deliver it to the larger interlobar lymphatics. Lymph from the cutaneous and\\nnipple–areolar regions may drain either directly into the subareolar plexus or deeply into the\\nparenchymatous lymph system. Once in the deep parenchymatous drainage, the lymph is delivered to\\nthe subareolar plexus for efferent transport.\\nThe majority of lymphatic drainage from both the retroareolar and the deep interlobar lymphatics\\nof the breast travel to the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes. The route of drainage to the highest axillary\\nnode or nodes is not reproducible from patient to patient. In general, however, the drainage of the\\nbreast is to the anterior axillary or subpectoral nodes, which are located deep to the lateral border of\\nthe pectoralis major muscle, close to the lateral thoracic artery. From these nodes, lymph travels to\\nnodes in close proximity to the lateral portion of the axillary vein. The lymph then passes superiorly,\\nvia the axillary chain of lymph vessels and nodes. Eventually, the drainage reaches the highest nodes\\nof the axilla. Although this is the most regular pattern of lateral and superior breast lymphatic\\ndrainage, other paths are common, particularly when the lateral and superiorly directed channels are\\nobstructed, for example, by tumor masses.\\nSurgeons usually classify the axillary lymph nodes in levels according to their relationship with the\\npectoralis minor muscle.

Nerves Encountered During Axillary Dissection\\nThe lateral and anterior cutaneous branches of T4–6 supply the cutaneous tissues covering the breasts.\\nTwo major nerves \\nand 2 smaller groups of nerves are in close proximity to the breast area and thus\\nassume importance in breast surgery:\\n1. The \\nthoracodorsal nerve\\n, a branch of the posterior cord of the brachial plexus (C5–7), runs\\ninferiorly along with the subscapular artery lying close to the posterior axillary wall and the\\nventral surface of the subscapular muscle. The nerve innervates the superior half of the latissimus\\ndorsi muscle and is usually surrounded by a large venous plexus that drains into the subscapular\\nveins.\\n2. The \\nlong thoracic nerve\\n (nerve of Bell) arises from the anterior primary divisions of C5–7 at the\\nlevel of the lower half of the anterior scalene muscle. In the neck, the nerve descends dorsal to the\\ntrunks of the brachial plexus on the inferior segment of the middle scalene muscle. Further\\ndescent places it dorsal to the clavicle and the axillary vessels. On the lateral thoracic wall, it\\ndescends on the external surface of the serratus anterior muscle along the anterior axillary line.\\nThe long thoracic nerve supplies filaments to each of the digitations of the serratus anterior\\nmuscle. Injury to this nerve results in a “winged” scapula.\\n3. The \\nintercostal brachial nerves\\n are 3 relatively minor cutaneous nerves that supply the skin of\\nthe medial surface of the upper arm. They transverse the lateral chest wall to the upper inner\\nsurface of the arm, passing across the base of the axilla.\\n4. The \\nmedial and lateral pectoral nerves\\n supply the 2 pectoral muscles and pass from the axilla to\\nthe lateral chest wall. The lateral pectoral nerve, which arises from the lateral cord of the plexus,\\npierces the clavipectoral fascia membrane together with the thoracoacromial artery and supplies\\nthe pectoralis major muscle. The medial pectoral nerve, which arises from the medial cord of the\\nbrachial plexus but ends up being lateral to the lateral pectoral nerve, pierces the clavipectoral\\nfascia and supplies the pectoralis minor muscle.\\nDISEASES OF THE BREAST\\nFIBROCYSTIC BREAST CHANGES\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n Painful, often multiple, usually bilateral mobile masses in the breast.\\n Rapid fluctuation in the size of the masses is common.\\n Frequently, pain occurs or increases, as does size during the premenstrual phase of the cycle.\\n Most common age is 30–50 years; occurrence is rare in postmenopausal women.\\nPathogenesis'),\n",

The term is imprecise and encompasses a wide spectrum of pathologic entities. The\\nlesions are always associated with benign changes in the breast epithelium, some of which are found\\nso frequently in normal breasts that they are probably variants of normal breast histology, but have,\\nunfortunately, been termed a “disease.” From a clinical standpoint, this entity is best described as\\nnodular, sensitive breast.\\nClinical Findings\\nFibrocystic changes are common and affect more than 50% of women of reproductive age. These\\nchanges are thought to be the result of a hormonal imbalance that may produce asymptomatic breast\\nlumps that are discovered by palpation. Cyclical breast pain or tenderness is often the presenting\\nsymptom and calls attention to the mass. The pain is caused by the proliferation of normal glandular\\nbreast tissue with estrogen stimulating the ductal elements and progesterone stimulating the stroma.\\nThere may be nonbloody, green or brown discharge from the nipple. In many cases, discomfort occurs\\nor is increased during the premenstrual phase of the cycle. Fluctuations in size and rapid appearance\\nor disappearance of a breast mass are common in cystic changes. In many women, caffeine seems to\\npotentiate these symptoms. However, the role of caffeine as a direct cause of these symptoms has\\nnever been proven. Pain, fluctuation in size, and multiplicity of lesions are the features most helpful in\\ndifferentiation from carcinoma. However, if a dominant mass is present, it should be evaluated by\\nbiopsy. Pathologists refer to a variety of histologic findings associated with fibrocystic changes\\nincluding fibrosis, ductal hyperplasia, and adenosis.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nPain, fluctuation in size, and multiplicity of lesions help to differentiate these lesions from carcinoma\\nand the benign entity of fibroadenoma. Final diagnosis often rests on biopsy and pathologic\\ndetermination. Ultrasonography may be helpful in the diagnosis; mammography is usually not\\nindicated for women under the age of 30 as the breast tissue in these young women may be too\\nradiodense to allow a meaningful evaluation. Aspiration and/or sonography may be useful in\\ndifferentiating a cystic from a solid mass.\\nTreatment\\nOnce a benign diagnosis or normal findings have been established by biopsy or on clinical or imaging\\nfindings, simple reassurance will provide many patients with adequate relief.\\nFor those patients who still seek treatment, symptomatic relief by avoiding trauma and by wearing\\na bra \\nwith adequate support can be very helpful. The role of caffeine consumption in the development\\nand treatment of fibrocystic change has never been proven; however, many patients report relief of\\nsymptoms after abstinence from coffee, tea, and chocolate. Similarly, observational studies have\\nsuggested that low-fat diets can provide some relief. The data regarding the utility of vitamin E\\nsupplementation and evening primrose oil are controversial. Mild analgesics such as acetaminophen\\nand nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to relieve breast pain.

The tumor is usually discovered accidentally. Clinical diagnosis in young patients is\\ngenerally not difficult. Fibroadenomas typically present as well-defined solid masses with benign\\nimaging features on ultrasound and can be managed with core needle biopsy or short-term (3–6\\nmonths) follow-up with a repeat ultrasound and breast examination.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nDefinitive diagnosis can only be confirmed with a core biopsy or excision if the patient is\\nsymptomatic or wishes the mass to be excised. Cryoablation is an alternative to surgical excision of\\nfibroadenomas, but should only be considered after a core biopsy diagnosis of fibroadenoma has been\\nmade.\\nRapid growth sometimes raises the suspicion for a phyllodes tumor and can mandate an excision to\\nconfirm the diagnosis and rule out a malignancy.\\nSimple fibroadenomas do not raise the subsequent risk of breast cancer, although the presence of\\nadjacent proliferative changes or a complex fibroadenoma is associated with a slightly increased risk.\\nPhyllodes tumors of the breast (previously called cystosarcoma phyllodes) are fibroepithelial\\ntumors that tend to grow rapidly and may sometimes be confused with benign fibroadenomas.

In addition, a woman who has had cancer in 1\\nbreast is at increased risk of not only a recurrence but also of a second primary in the ipsilateral\\nbreast, as well as in the contralateral breast. Women with cancer of the uterine corpus have a breast\\ncancer risk significantly higher than that of the general population, and women with breast cancer\\nhave a comparably increased risk of endometrial cancer.\\nWomen who are at greater-than-normal risk of developing breast cancer should be identified by\\ntheir physicians and followed carefully. Screening programs involve periodic physical examination\\nand screening mammography; screening magnetic resonance imaging of the breasts for those\\nasymptomatic patients at highest risk may increase the detection rate of breast cancer and may\\nimprove the survival rate, although this has not yet been demonstrated. Unfortunately, more than 50%\\nof women who develop breast cancer do not have significant identifiable risk factors.\\nStaging\\nThe physical examination of the breast and additional pre-operative studies are used to determine the\\nclinical stage of a breast cancer. Clinical staging is based on the TNM (tumor, node, metastasis)\\nsystem of the International Union Against Cancer. This classification considers tumor size, clinical\\nassessment of axillary nodes, and the presence or absence of distant metastases. The assessment of the\\nclinical stage is important in planning therapy. Histologic (or pathologic) staging is determined\\nfollowing surgery and along with clinical staging helps determine prognosis.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe majority of patients with breast cancer are diagnosed as a result of an abnormal mammogram and\\nless often because of a palpable mass. The initial evaluation should include assessment of the local\\nlesion, including a bilateral mammogram, if not previously performed, and breast ultrasound as\\nindicated. The initial workup should include laboratory tests such as a complete blood count, liver\\nfunction tests, and alkaline phosphatase. The search for distant spread should only be reserved for\\nlocally advanced breast cancers or if signs/symptoms of distant spread are present.\\nA. Symptoms\\nWhen the history is taken, special note should be made of the onset and duration of menarche,\\npregnancies, parity, artificial or natural menopause, date of last menstrual period, previous breast\\nlesions and/or biopsies, hormonal supplementation, radiation exposure, and a family history of breast\\ncancer. Back or other bone pain may be the result of osseous metastases. Systemic complaints or\\nweight loss should raise the question of metastases, which may involve any organ but most frequently\\ninvolve the bones, liver, and lungs. The more advanced the cancer in terms of aggressive histologic\\nfeatures, size of primary lesion, local invasion, and extent of regional node involvement, the higher is\\nthe incidence of metastatic spread to distant sites. Lymph node involvement is the single most\\nsignificant prognostic feature and increases with increasing tumor size and aggressive histologic\\nfeatures such as pathologic grade.\\nMost patients with palpable breast cancers present with painless masses in the breast, most of\\nwhich are discovered by the patient herself. Less frequent symptoms are breast pain; nipple discharge;\\nerosion, retraction, enlargement, or itching of the nipple; and redness, generalized hardness,'),\n",

Rarely, an axillary mass, swelling of the arm, or bone pain\\n(from metastases) may be the first symptoms.

Signs\\nInspection of the breast is the first step in physical examination and should be carried out with the\\npatient sitting, arms at sides and then overhead. Abnormal variations in breast size and contour,\\nminimal nipple retraction, and slight edema, redness, or retraction of the skin can be identified.\\nAsymmetry of the breasts and retraction or dimpling of the skin can often be accentuated by having\\nthe patient raise her arms overhead or press her hands on her hips in order to contract the pectoralis\\nmuscles. Axillary and supraclavicular areas should be thoroughly palpated for enlarged nodes with the\\npatient sitting (\\nFig. 5–4\\n). Palpation of the breast for masses or other changes should be performed\\nwith the patient both seated and supine with the arm abducted (\\nFig. 5–5\\n).\\nFigure 5–4\\n. Palpation of axillary region for enlarged lymph nodes.\\nFigure 5–5\\n. Palpation of breasts.

Slight skin or nipple retraction is an important sign as it may\\naffect staging. Minimal asymmetry of the breast may be noted. Very small (1–2-mm) erosions of the\\nnipple epithelium may be the only manifestation of Paget’s carcinoma.

The axillary lymph nodes receive more than 85%\\nof the lymphatic drainage from the breast. One or 2 movable, nontender, not particularly firm axillary\\nlymph nodes 5 mm or less in diameter are frequently present and are generally of no clinical\\nsignificance. Any firm or hard nodes larger than 5 mm in diameter are highly suspicious for nodal\\nmetastases. Axillary nodes that are matted or fixed to skin or deep structures indicate locally advanced\\ndisease (at least stage III). Histologic studies show that microscopic metastases are present in\\napproximately 40% of patients with clinically negative nodes. Conversely, if the examiner believes\\nthat the axillary nodes are involved, this is confirmed in approximately 85% of cases on pathologic\\nexamination. The incidence of positive axillary nodes increases with the size of the primary tumor, the\\ndegree of local invasiveness of the neoplasm, and certain aggressive histologic features such as tumor\\ngrade.\\nUsually no nodes are palpable in the supraclavicular fossa. Firm or hard nodes of any size in this\\nlocation or just beneath the clavicle (infraclavicular nodes) are indicative of locally advanced disease\\nand suggest the strong possibility of distant metastatic sites of cancer. Biopsy or fine-needle\\naspiration to confirm nodal involvement in these areas is paramount. Ipsilateral supraclavicular nodes\\ncontaining cancer indicate that the patient is in an advanced stage of the disease (stage IIIC). Edema\\nof the ipsilateral arm, commonly caused by metastatic infiltration of regional lymphatics, is also a\\nsign of advanced cancer.\\nC. Special Clinical Forms of Breast Carcinoma\\n1. Paget’s disease of the breast\\n—Paget’s disease of the breast refers to the eczematoid eruption and\\nulceration that arises from the nipple, can spread to the areola, and is associated with an underlying\\ncarcinoma. An underlying mass is palpable in about 50% of patients with Paget’s disease. Of these\\nmasses, 95% are found to be an invasive cancer, mostly infiltrating ductal. For patients with Paget’s\\ndisease and no underlying palpable mass, a noninvasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ is\\nfound in 75% of cases. Pain, itching, and/or burning are often the presenting symptoms, along with a\\nsuperficial erosion or ulceration. Less frequently, a bloody discharge and nipple retraction are\\nobserved. The diagnosis is established most often by full-thickness biopsy of the lesion, which reveals\\nthe pathognomonic intraepithelial adenocarcinoma cells or Paget cells within the epidermis of the\\nnipple. In 12–15% of patients with Paget’s disease of the breast, no associated underlying\\nintraparenchymal breast cancer is found.\\nPaget’s disease is uncommon, accounting for approximately 1% of all breast cancers. It is\\nfrequently misdiagnosed and treated as dermatitis or bacterial infection, leading to an unfortunate\\ndelay in detection. Mastectomy has traditionally been the mainstay of therapy, although breast\\nconservation followed by whole breast radiation can be attempted if nipple, areola, and wide local\\nexcision of the palpable mass or area of mammographic abnormality can be performed with an'),\n",

As for other forms of breast cancer, patients with\\nonly in situ \\ndisease need not have axillary evaluation, which is reserved for patients with an\\nunderlying palpable mass/invasive carcinoma or if a mastectomy is planned.\\n2. Inflammatory carcinoma\\n—Inflammatory carcinoma is an aggressive form of breast cancer that is\\ncharacterized by diffuse, brawny edema of the skin of the breast with an erysipeloid border, usually\\nwithout an underlying palpable mass. Generally, this is a clinical diagnosis with pathologic\\nconfirmation of tumor embolization in the dermal lymphatics by biopsy of the overlying skin and\\nshould not be confused with noninflammatory locally advanced breast cancer. Inflammatory breast\\ncancer is an aggressive but rare form of breast cancer representing less than 5% of cases. At\\npresentation, nearly 35% of patients with inflammatory breast cancer have evidence of metastases.\\nThe inflammatory component, often mistaken for an infectious process, is caused by the blockage of\\ndermal lymphatics by tumor emboli, which results in lymphedema and hyperemia. If a suspected skin\\ninfection does not rapidly respond (1–2 weeks) to a course of antibiotics, biopsy must be performed.\\nTreatment usually consists of several cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and/or\\nradiotherapy depending on tumor response. A modified radical mastectomy is usually recommended\\nfor locoregional control as long as a complete resection of the tumor can be accomplished.\\n3. Occurrence during pregnancy or lactation\\n—Pregnancy-associated breast cancer is defined as\\nbreast cancer that is diagnosed during pregnancy, in the first postpartum year, or anytime during\\nlactation. The frequency of breast cancer during pregnancy or lactation ranges between 1:3000 and\\n1:10,000. The association of pregnancy and breast cancer presents a diagnostic and therapeutic\\ndilemma for the patient and the physician. Women with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or\\nlactation tend to present at a later stage due in part to diagnostic delays. In the past, pregnancy-\\nassociated breast cancer was thought to lead to a worse outcome for the patient. More recent studies,\\nhowever, have reported similar outcomes for women with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy\\nand lactation when compared with nonpregnant breast cancer patients after controlling for stage, age,\\nand other prognostic factors. Termination of the pregnancy, formerly performed routinely in the first\\ntwo trimesters, has not been demonstrated to improve outcome. In most instances, modified radical\\nmastectomy in pregnancy is the minimal treatment of choice, with the possible exception of the latter\\npart of the third trimester, wherein breast-conservation therapy followed by postpartum radiotherapy\\nmay be considered. Most women with breast cancer diagnosed during pregnancy or lactation will be\\ncandidates for systemic chemotherapy. In general, the risk of fetal teratogenicity is highest during the\\nfirst trimester and period of organogenesis. In the second or third trimester, chemotherapy is\\nassociated with a much lower risk or fetal toxicity but has been significantly linked to an increased\\nrisk of prematurity and growth retardation. In general, antimetabolites such as methotrexate, targeted\\nantibodies such as trastuzumab, taxanes, and endocrine therapy should be avoided during pregnancy.\\nDelivery of the infant should be delayed for a few weeks after the last dose of chemotherapy in order\\nto minimize the risk of neutropenia in the fetus and infectious complication. The use of radiotherapy\\nduring pregnancy is contraindicated because of the potential for fetal damage. The decision to proceed\\nwith pregnancy termination should be individualized and based on the willingness of the patient to\\naccept the potential teratogenic risk incurred by her breast cancer therapy.\\n4. Bilateral breast cancer\\n—Clinically evident simultaneous bilateral breast cancer occurs in less than\\n1% of cases, but there is a 5–8% incidence of later occurrence of cancer in the second breast.\\nBilaterality occurs more often in women younger than age 50 years and is more frequently associated\\nwith a lobular carcinoma and in patients with hereditary breast cancer syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni'),\n",

The incidence of second breast cancers increases directly with the length of time the\\npatient is alive after her first cancer and is approximately 1.0% per year and is significantly higher in\\npatients with hereditary breast cancer syndromes.\\nIn patients with breast cancer, careful screening of the contralateral breast at the time of initial\\ndiagnosis and at regular intervals thereafter is warranted. Routine biopsy of the opposite breast is\\nusually not indicated.\\nD. Mammography\\nMammography is the breast imaging modality of choice and the only screening method that has been\\nconsistently found to decrease mortality of breast cancer. Some breast cancers can be identified by\\nmammography as early as 2 years before reaching a size detectable by palpation.\\nAlthough false-positive and false-negative results are occasionally obtained with mammography,\\nthe experienced radiologist can interpret mammograms correctly in approximately 90% of cases.\\nUltrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are not recommended for screening the general\\npopulation, and their primary role is as adjuncts to an abnormal mammogram. For women at high risk\\nfor developing breast cancer, the addition of MRI and ultrasound to screening mammograms may be\\ncontemplated.\\nBecause up to 15% of cancers that are detected on clinical exams are not seen on mammograms, a\\nnegative mammogram should preclude further intervention in patients with a dominant or suspicious\\nmass. The use of a targeted ultrasound can help decrease the false-negative rate of mammograms and\\nevaluate the mammographically occult palpable breast mass.\\nE. Cytology\\nCytologic examination of nipple discharge or cyst fluid may be helpful on rare occasions. As a rule,\\nmammography and \\nbreast biopsy are required when nipple discharge or cyst fluid is bloody or\\ncytologically equivocal.\\nF. Biopsy\\nThe diagnosis of breast cancer depends ultimately on examination of tissue removed by biopsy.\\nTreatment should never be undertaken without an unequivocal histologic diagnosis of cancer. The\\nsafest course is biopsy examination of all suspicious masses found on physical examination and, in the\\nabsence of a mass, of suspicious lesions demonstrated by mammography. Approximately 30% of\\nlesions thought to be definitely cancer prove on biopsy to be benign, and approximately 15% of\\nlesions believed to be benign are found to be malignant. These findings demonstrate the fallibility of\\nclinical judgment and the necessity for biopsy.\\nThe simplest method is by fine-needle aspiration (FNA). This method is, however, limited by its\\ninability to distinguish invasive from noninvasive breast cancers and the relatively high rate of\\nnondiagnostic studies, especially for nonpalpable abnormalities and with less experienced\\npractitioners.\\nIn many centers, core needle biopsies, most often with image guidance, have replaced open surgical\\nbiopsies. Core needle biopsies offer the advantage of a more definitive histologic diagnosis, minimize\\nthe risk of inadequate samples, and allow the distinction between invasive and noninvasive breast\\ncancers. Open surgical biopsies, often with wire localization, should be reserved for those lesions that\\nare technically unattainable with core needle biopsies or in the event of core needle biopsy results that\\ndo not correlate with the imaging findings (discordant results).\\nIn general, outpatient biopsy followed by definitive surgery at a later date gives patients time to'),\n",

Tumor\\nanalysis using reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technology from pathologic\\nspecimens to assess the tumor recurrence risk is now available. Such tests can aid the patient and\\nphysician in the decision for further adjuvant therapy or not.

Laboratory Findings\\nA complete blood cell count (CBC), chemistry panel including liver function tests (LFTs), and a β-\\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) in premenopausal patients should be obtained as part of the\\ninitial evaluation. An elevation in alkaline phosphatase or liver function may be an indication of\\ndistant metastatic disease and warrants further investigation. Hypercalcemia may be seen in advanced\\ncases of metastatic cancer.\\nH. Imaging Studies\\nMost systematic reviews have concluded that the routine radiologic evaluation for metastatic disease\\nis unnecessary in the majority of patients since the overall yield is low. In general, the prevalence of\\nmetastatic disease increases with the clinical stage of the disease. The Cancer Care Ontario Practice\\nGuidelines Initiative recommends against routine staging for clinical stage I disease, whereas they\\nrecommend routine staging in patients with stage III disease and radio-nuclide bone scanning in\\npatients with stage II disease. In general, imaging studies should be limited to patients with higher\\npretest probability of distant metastases, such as those with signs, symptoms, or laboratory\\nabnormalities suggestive of distant metastases and those with locally advanced breast cancer.\\nThe imaging modality of choice has not been standardized, although computed tomography (CT)\\nscanning of chest, abdomen, and pelvis offers a more sensitive and attractive 1-visit option at the price\\nof a higher risk of false-positive results, cost, and radiation exposure. In addition, evaluation for\\nskeletal metastases with radionuclide bone scans would still be required.\\nThe combination of positron emission tomography (PET) and CT scans is a promising tool in the\\nstaging and metastatic evaluation of breast cancer because it allows for the evaluation of visceral and\\nbony metastases. However, data regarding its routine use in the metastatic workup of patients with\\nbreast cancer are lacking.\\nThe American Society of Clinical Oncology has found that there is insufficient evidence to support\\nthe routine use of tumor markers such as CA 15-3, CA 27.29, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA).

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='The majority of breast cancers in the United States are detected as a result of an abnormal screening\\nstudy. In general, depending on a woman’s age and the density of her breasts, the sensitivity of\\nmammography is 70–90%, and its specificity is greater than 90%. Yearly mammogram screening\\namong \\nwomen continues to increase, so that in 1997, roughly 85% of women had had a mammogram\\nat least once previously. This was an increase of 15% from 1990 and of 47% from 1987. In 2008, the\\nproportion of US women age 50–74 years who reported that they had a screening mammogram in the\\npreceding 2 years was 81.1%. Lack of insurance coverage and lower socioeconomic status were\\nassociated with significantly lower prevalence of up-to-date mammography.\\nDespite a consensus on the importance of mammographic screening, mammography has still not\\nbeen demonstrated unequivocally to decrease breast cancer mortality across all age groups. In women\\nbetween 50 and 69 years of age, there is reasonable evidence, based largely on 8 randomized\\ncontrolled trials, that screening mammography is beneficial. In elderly patients over the age of 70\\nyears, however, the optimal frequency of screening is still unknown because they have not generally\\nbeen included in most large cooperative screening trials and because of their limited life expectancy,\\nwhich can affect gains in breast mortality. For younger women, the evidence is also not entirely clear.\\nFor women age 40–49 years, there appears to be a small benefit, which comes at the price of a higher\\nnumber of patients in that age group who need to be screened. These results may be due to the lower\\nprevalence of the disease and decreased sensitivity of mammograms in this age group as well as the\\npossibility that younger women have faster growing tumors, which may be more readily missed at one\\nscreening and become clinically apparent before the subsequent screening. Nevertheless, in the Health\\nInsurance Plan of Greater New York screening study from the United States, which with 18 years has\\nthe longest follow-up of any randomized mammography screening study, there was a 30% reduction\\nin mortality in women older than 50 years of age. Despite academic debate and challenges and\\ncontroversy in the news media, the consensus that screening mammography saves lives has been\\nupheld.\\nCurrent screening recommendations from the American College of Radiology, the American\\nCancer Society, and the American Medical Association call for annual mammograms starting at age\\n40 years. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists calls for screening mammography\\nevery 1–2 years for women age 40–49 and annually thereafter. There is no recommendation for a\\n“baseline” examination prior to age 40 years, nor is there any evidence to support this practice in\\nwomen younger than this age.

Genetic Testing\\nA positive family history of breast cancer is recognized as a risk factor for the subsequent\\ndevelopment of breast cancer.

Of all women with breast cancer, approximately 5–10% may\\nhave mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2. The estimated risk of a patient developing cancer with a\\nBRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation is believed to be between 40% and 85%. Particular mutations may be\\nmore common in specific ethnic groups like the Ashkenazi Jewish population. Genetic testing is\\navailable and may be considered for members of high-risk families. The US Preventive Task Force,\\nKaiser Permanente, and the National Cancer Center Network have developed BRCA testing guidelines\\n(\\nTable 5–2\\n).

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='types are distinguished by the histologic appearance and growth pattern of the tumor. In general,\\nbreast cancer arises either from the epithelial lining of the \\nlarge or intermediate-sized ducts (ductal)\\nor from the epithelium of the terminal ducts of the lobules (lobular). The cancer may be invasive or in\\nsitu. Most breast cancers arise from the intermediate ducts and are invasive (invasive ductal or\\ninfiltrating ductal), and most histologic types are merely subtypes of invasive ductal cancer with\\nunusual growth patterns (colloid, medullary, tubular, etc).\\nTable 5–3\\n. Histologic types of breast cancer.\\nThe histologic subtypes have only slight bearing on prognosis when outcomes are compared after\\naccurate staging. Colloid (mucinous), medullary, papillary, adenoid cystic, and tubular histologies are\\ngenerally believed to have a more favorable prognosis. Other histologic criteria have been studied in\\nan attempt to substratify patients based on features such as tumor differentiation, lymphovascular\\nspace invasion, and tumor necrosis. Although these characteristics are important, stage is predominant\\nand paramount in predicting outcome.\\nThe noninvasive cancers by definition lack the ability to spread. However, in patients whose\\nbiopsies show noninvasive intraductal cancer, associated invasive ductal cancers are present in 1–3%\\nof cases. Lobular carcinoma in situ is considered by some to be a premalignant lesion that by itself is\\nnot a true cancer. It lacks the ability to spread but is associated with the subsequent development of\\ninvasive ductal cancer in 25–30% of cases within 15 years.\\nHormone Receptor Sites\\nThe presence or absence of estrogen and/or progesterone receptors in the nucleus of tumor cells is of\\ncritical importance in managing patients with initial, recurrent, and metastatic disease. Both estrogen\\nreceptors (ERs) and progesterone receptors (PRs) are nuclear hormone receptors. After binding their\\nrespective hormones in the cytoplasm of the target cell, the DNA-binding sites on the receptor are\\nunmasked, and the activated complex migrates into the nucleus in order to bind to their respective\\nhormone-responsive DNA elements. The responsiveness of breast cancer to hormonal therapy is best\\npredicted by tumor expression of the ER and/or PR, and ER/PR-negative tumors are unlikely to\\nbenefit from endocrine therapy and would be better treated with systemic chemotherapy. Conversely,\\nthe magnitude of benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy is directly related to the amount of ER.\\nERs may be of prognostic significance, but current evidence is still unclear. For small node-\\nnegative tumors, the presence of ER is associated with lower likelihood of recurrence at 5 years when\\ncompared to ER-poor tumors. With longer follow-up, however, this initial advantage disappears\\nprimarily due to late recurrences.

Overexpression of the glycoprotein and/or\\namplification of its encoding gene is noted in 18–20% of breast cancer patients. HER2\\noverexpression/amplification is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and breast cancer\\ndeath in the absence of systemic/targeted therapy and is also associated with resistance to endocrine\\ntherapy. However, HER2 overexpression/overamplification helps identify patients who benefit from\\nthe addition of agents that target the protein such as trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal mouse\\nantibody that binds the HER2 protein, and lapatinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks\\nHER2. At least 4 large randomized controlled trials have shown that the addition of 1 year of\\ntrastuzumab to adjuvant therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer significantly improves\\ntheir disease-free and overall survival.\\nCurative Treatment\\nAll oncologic treatment may be classified as curative or palliative. Curative treatment intent is\\nadvised for early-stage and locally advanced disease (clinical stages I to IIIC disease). Treatment\\nintent is palliative for patients with stage IV disease and for previously treated patients who develop\\ndistant metastases or unresectable local recurrence.\\nA. Therapeutic Options\\n1. Radical mastectomy\\n—Historically, Halsted is credited with performing the first modern radical\\nmastectomy in 1882 in the United States. This surgical procedure was the en bloc removal of the\\nbreast, pectoral muscles, and axillary lymph nodes. It was the standard surgical procedure performed\\nfor breast cancer in the United States from the turn of the 20th century until the 1950s. During the\\n1950s, emerging information about lymph node drainage patterns prompted surgeons to undertake the\\nextended radical mastectomy, which is a radical mastectomy and the removal of the internal\\nmammary lymph nodes. It was postulated that a more extensive dissection of the draining lymphatics\\nwould improve control rates and translate into improved survival. A randomized trial, however,\\nproved no benefit to the extended radical mastectomy versus the radical mastectomy, and the former\\nwas abandoned. Moreover, the failure of the extended radical mastectomy underscored the\\ncomplications and morbidity of breast cancer surgery. This morbidity coupled with inadequate disease\\ncontrol led surgeons to explore less invasive and disfiguring techniques. Currently, radical\\nmastectomy is rarely indicated or performed. Even in settings where radical resection may be'),\n",

Modified radical mastectomy\\n—Replacing radical mastectomy, the modified radical mastectomy\\n(MRM) is the removal of the breast and underlying pectoralis major fascia, but not the muscle, and\\nevaluation of selected axillary lymph nodes. Variations of this procedure include sacrificing the\\npectoralis minor muscle or not, and retracting, splitting, or transecting the pectoralis major to access\\nthe apex of the axilla for dissection. Because it is less invasive and less disfiguring, MRM provides a\\nbetter cosmetic and functional result than radical mastectomy. Two prospective randomized trials,\\nsingle-institution data, and several retrospective studies all demonstrate no difference in disease-free\\nor overall survival rates between radical mastectomy and MRM for early-stage breast cancer. Until\\nthe early 1980s and the emergence of breast-conservation therapy (BCT), MRM was the standard\\ntreatment available to women for early-stage cancer. For locally advanced breast cancer and when the\\npatient is not a candidate for BCT, or if the patient is not motivated for breast conservation, MRM\\nremains a valid treatment option. A total mastectomy (simple mastectomy) is the removal of the\\nwhole breast, like an MRM, without the axillary dissection.\\n3. Breast-conservation therapy\\n—BCT involves a surgical procedure such as a lumpectomy—an\\nexcision of the tumor mass with a negative surgical margin—an axillary evaluation, and postoperative\\nirradiation. Several other operations, more limited in the scope of surgical dissection than MRM, such\\nas segmental mastectomy, partial mastectomy, and quadrantectomy, are also used in conjunction with\\nradiation and are part of the surgical component of BCT. As a result of 6 prospective randomized\\ntrials that showed no significant difference in local relapse, distant metastases, or overall survival\\nbetween conservative surgery with radiation and mastectomy, BCT has gained increasing acceptance\\nas a treatment option for stage I and II and selected stage III breast cancers.\\nB. Choice of Local Therapy\\nBreast cancer is a multidisciplinary disease in which surgeons, medical and radiation oncologists,\\nradiologists, pathologists, nurses, and psychosocial support staff all play fundamental roles. Working\\nwith the patient, this team recommends the most appropriate treatment strategy. Clinical and\\npathologic stage, as well as biologic aggressiveness, are the principal determinants guiding local\\ntherapy, treatment strategy, and, ultimately, outcome. For early-stage breast cancer, including node-\\npositive cases, much of the decision for initial local therapy rests with the patient. MRM is always a\\nvalid choice for addressing the local treatment of breast cancer. A patient’s decision to undergo MRM\\ndoes not necessarily obviate the role of radiation in the further management of breast cancer, and\\npostmastectomy irradiation may still be recommended in approximately 20–25% of cases. To be a\\ncandidate for BCT, the patient must not be pregnant \\nand cannot have multicentric breast cancer\\n(evidence of cancer in >1 quadrant of the breast), locally advanced disease, diffuse microcalcifications\\non mammogram, or a prior history of ipsilateral breast irradiation. Relative contraindications are\\ncollagen-vascular disorders that could lead to a poor cosmetic outcome with irradiation and breast\\nimplants or psychiatric issues that would make close follow-up and surveillance difficult. These\\nrestrictions are only a portion of the decision-making process that must be completed before\\nembarking on BCT.\\nPerhaps most importantly, the patient must be motivated and desire to maintain her breast in the\\nface of a cancer diagnosis. This may entail some degree of physical, emotional, and psychological\\ndistress. For example, a patient may have to endure multiple re-excisions to obtain a negative surgical\\nmargin on the lumpectomy specimen. A patient may also experience resistance to BCT in areas where'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='it is not commonly offered and where a multidisciplinary approach to breast cancer is not practiced. It\\nhas been shown that the surgical management of breast cancer differs considerably based on\\ngeographic location in the United States, independent of patient and tumor characteristics.\\nNevertheless, both physicians and patients pursue BCT because it allows the patient to preserve her\\nbreast without any decrement to survival, and the vast majority of women are pleased with the\\ncosmetic result.\\nBecause the treatment options for locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancers are in some\\nways less flexible than those for early-stage breast cancer, it is even more critical to engage the\\npatient in the decision-making process for the choice of initial therapy. Many different strategies,\\nwhich include mastectomy and less invasive surgeries, with or without neoadjuvant chemotherapy and\\nadjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, and further maintenance interventions, are commonly used. In\\nmany settings, protocol therapy may be the most desirable treatment option.\\nMastectomy\\nFor about three-quarters of a century, radical mastectomy was considered standard therapy for breast\\ncancer. The procedure was designed to remove the primary lesion, the breast in which it arose, the\\nunderlying muscle, and, by dissection in continuity, the axillary lymph nodes, which are most often\\nthe first site of regional spread beyond the breast. When radical mastectomy was introduced by\\nHalsted, the average patient presented for treatment with locally advanced disease, and a relatively\\nextensive procedure was often necessary just to remove all gross cancer. This is no longer the case.\\nPatients now present with much smaller, less locally advanced lesions. Most of the patients in\\nHalsted’s original series would now be considered incurable by surgery alone, because they had\\nextensive involvement of the chest wall, skin, and supraclavicular regions. Since the 1960s, MRM has\\nsupplanted the radical mastectomy because of its comparable disease control and a substantial\\ndecrease in morbidity and disfiguration.\\nIn many cases, adjuvant therapy after MRM (eg, radiation) can even further reduce the incidence of\\nlocal recurrence in certain patients with unfavorable tumor characteristics. In addition, 3 recent\\nrandomized trials of postmastectomy radiation, which confirmed a local control advantage,\\ndemonstrated an overall survival benefit in certain subsets of both pre- and postmenopausal women.\\nFor patients with ≥4 positive lymph nodes or large tumors ≥5 cm in diameter, postmastectomy\\nradiation is strongly recommended. The role of postmastectomy radiation in patients with 1–3 positive\\nnodes is more controversial. However, with increasing duration of follow-up, there is emerging\\nevidence in favor of postmastectomy radiation for patients with 1–3 positive lymph nodes. Therefore,\\nwhen deciding on initial local therapy, a patient must keep in mind that choosing MRM does not\\nnecessarily exclude a recommendation for adjuvant radiation.\\nBreast-Conservation Therapy\\nBecause studies comparing radical mastectomy and MRM demonstrated no decrement in local control\\nor survival, radical mastectomy has given way to MRM. In the 1980s, 6 prospective randomized trials\\nwere conducted worldwide that showed no significant difference in locoregional relapse or overall\\nsurvival between breast-conserving surgery and radiation versus MRM for early-stage invasive breast\\ncancer. In addition, an overview analysis showed equivalent survival with BCT as compared to\\nmastectomy. Two of these studies included patients with node-positive breast cancer. With the\\naddition of radiation to breast-conserving surgery techniques such as lumpectomy with an axillary\\nevaluation, local failure is reduced to rates comparable to MRM with no compromise to overall\\nsurvival.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='There are a few absolute contraindications to BCT, which are mainly related to increased rates of\\nin-breast recurrences or preclusion of use of radiation. These include persistently positive surgical\\nmargins, multicentric disease present in more than 1 quadrant of the breast, diffuse malignant-\\nappearing calcifications throughout the breast precluding adequate resection, history of prior radiation\\ntherapy to the breast, and pregnancy. Other relative contraindications include a history of scleroderma\\ndue to an increased risk of skin toxicity associated with radiation and the large size of the tumor\\nrelative to the size of the breast, resulting in an unacceptable cosmetic outcome. Factors that are not\\ncontraindications to breast conservation include nodal metastases, tumor location, tumor subtype, and\\na family history of breast cancer.\\nUnfortunately, no subgroup of patient with breast cancer undergoing breast conservation has a low\\nenough risk of recurrence to justify the elimination of adjuvant therapy. Some investigators are\\ncurrently examining alternative strategies of delivering radiotherapy such partial breast irradiation\\nand shortened courses of whole breast radiation in select patients with node-negative disease.\\nAxillary Evaluation\\nIt is important to recognize that axillary evaluation is valuable both in planning therapy and in staging\\nof the cancer. Axillary lymph node dissection has long been the mainstay for axillary staging in the\\ntreatment of patients with breast cancer. Although the removal of even occult cancer in axillary lymph\\nnodes generally does not translate into an improvement in overall survival rates, regional failures will\\nbe lower. Axillary lymph node dissection is generally safe but may result in nerve damage and\\nlymphedema, especially in patients receiving postoperative radiotherapy. Because of the potential for\\nmajor morbidity associated with the procedure and questions regarding any survival advantage it\\nwould offer, some investigators examined the use of sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) as an\\nalternative to formal axillary dissection for the pathologic assessment of the clinically negative axilla.\\nThis procedure uses a tracer material that is injected into the tumor bed to map the tumor drainage to\\nthe primary or “sentinel” axillary lymph node(s). The sentinel lymph node is excised and\\npathologically examined. If the sentinel lymph node is found to harbor metastatic disease, a\\nsubsequent formal dissection is done. Conversely, if the sentinel lymph node is negative, no further\\nsurgical evaluation need be performed. Although this procedure relies heavily on the surgeon’s\\nexpertise with a new technique and has some inherent limitations, when performed by an experienced\\nteam, a negative result carries a negative predictive value of 94–96%. Potential side effects and\\ncomplications are minimized, and recovery is quick without sacrificing diagnostic or therapeutic\\nresults. A practical example of the benefits of SLNB is that, when used in conjunction with BCT,\\nreported rates of lymphedema are lower than with axillary dissection.\\nAdjuvant Systemic Therapy\\nA. Hormonal Therapy\\nAdjuvant hormonal therapy or manipulation is recommended for all women whose breast cancer\\nexpresses hormone receptors. Even if the tumor does not express estrogen hormone receptor protein\\nbut only progesterone, hormonal therapy may be beneficial. This recommendation is made regardless\\nof age, menopausal status, involvement or number of positive lymph nodes, or tumor size. The benefit\\nof adjuvant hormonal therapy is seen across all subgroups of breast cancer patients, with both invasive\\nand in situ lesions. Although the absolute decrease in recurrence, second primary breast cancer, and\\ndeath may vary from group to group, there is a firmly established role for adjuvant hormonal\\nintervention.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Until recently, 5 years of tamoxifen was considered to be the adjuvant hormonal therapy regimen\\nof choice and remains a valuable option for both premenopausal and post-menopausal women with\\nER-positive tumors. Randomized trials support the 5-year duration, which is superior to shorter\\ncourses and does not expose the patient to the increased risk of adverse effects associated with longer\\nuse. Furthermore, use longer than 5 years does not appear to enhance the long-term benefit seen with\\njust 5 years of use. Although tamoxifen carries an increased risk of endometrial cancer and venous\\nthromboembolism, the benefits outweigh the risks for the vast number of patients. Surveillance\\nscreening procedures such as transvaginal ultrasound and endometrial biopsy are not necessary in\\nasymptomatic patients on tamoxifen.\\nMore recently, aromatase inhibitors (AI) such as anastrozole have been shown to be as effective if\\nnot more effective than tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early-stage, invasive breast cancer.\\nIn fact, in at least 2 large trials, anastrozole and letrozole were found to be superior to tamoxifen in\\nterms of disease-free survival, time to recurrence, and the incidence of contralateral breast cancer,\\nalthough no significant difference in overall survival was seen. The toxicity profile of AIs is also\\ndifferent, making them useful for women who would like to avoid the tamoxifen-related side effects.\\nCompared to tamoxifen, the use of AIs confers a smaller risk of endometrial cancer, venous\\nthromboembolic events, and hot flashes. However, AIs are associated with a higher risk of\\nmusculoskeletal disorders, osteoporosis, and cardiac events when compared to tamoxifen. AIs are not\\ntypically used in premenopausal patients because the reduced estrogen feedback on the hypothalamus\\nresults in an increase in gonadotropin release, which paradoxically stimulates the ovary to produce\\nmore aromatase and androgen substrate.\\nB. Chemotherapy\\nCytotoxic chemotherapy is commonly offered to women as adjuvant treatment for both early-stage\\nand locally advanced breast cancer. The goal of adjuvant chemotherapy is to eliminate occult\\nmicroscopic metastases that are often responsible for late recurrences. Cytotoxic chemotherapy offers\\nbenefits to the many early and the majority of locally advanced breast cancer patients, although the\\nmagnitude of benefit is more pronounced in premenopausal and node-positive patients. Cytotoxic\\nchemotherapy is also considered by many to be the standard of care for patients with ER-negative\\ntumors who are candidates for adjuvant systemic therapy because of adverse prognostic indicators\\nsuch as tumor size >1 cm, positive lymph nodes, and high-grade disease.\\nThe benefit of adding chemotherapy to endocrine therapy for patients with ER-positive tumors is\\nmore controversial, especially for patients with negative lymph nodes. The Oncotype DX 21-gene\\nrecurrence score assay is a potentially useful tool that could help predict patients with node-negative\\nER-positive tumors who have the lowest risk of distant recurrence, enough to justify elimination of\\nchemotherapy.\\nPolychemotherapy (≥2 agents) is superior to single-agent chemotherapy. Duration for 3–6 months\\nor 4–6 cycles appears to offer optimal benefit without subjecting the patient to undue toxicity\\nassociated with more prolonged \\ntreatment, which adds little benefit in terms of overall outcome.\\nCytotoxic chemotherapy with an anthracycline-based (doxorubicin or epirubicin) regimen is favored,\\nbecause a small but statistically significant improvement in survival has been demonstrated compared\\nwith nonanthracycline-containing regimens. The cardiac toxicity caused by anthracyclines is not\\nconsidered detrimental in women without significant cardiac disease but does occur in 1% of cases or\\nless. Several trials have also demonstrated a survival advantage for regimens that include a taxane in\\naddition to an anthracycline, particularly in node-positive tumors and other higher risk tumors.\\nAlterations in dose schedule (eg, “dose-dense” regimens) also offer advantages over other'),\n",

As\\npreviously mentioned, several trials have shown that the addition of trastuzumab offers an overall and\\nrecurrence-free survival advantage in all but the most favorable HER2-positive tumors at the price of\\na small but significant increase in cardiac events, particularly for patients receiving an anthracycline-\\ncontaining regimen. However, emerging data suggest the equivalence of taxane-based combinations\\nwith trastuzumab and those combinations containing anthracyclines with less cardiac toxicity. The\\nchoice of adjuvant chemotherapy is complex. The medical oncologist must consider multiple tumor\\nand patient features and individualize treatment for breast cancer patients.\\nSeveral areas concerning chemotherapy have generated considerable interest but lack conclusive\\nevidence. For instance, high-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell rescue is not\\nrecommended. There is no evidence that high-dose regimens are superior to standard-dose\\npolychemotherapy. Stem cell support or bone marrow transplant should be offered only on protocol.\\nFurther investigation is also needed to clarify the role of other biologic agents and dosing schedules.\\nTrials need to enroll more patients older than age 70 years to assess the benefits and toxicities of\\nadjuvant chemotherapy in this population. Finally, studies designed to measure quality of life need to\\nbe done to place the benefits versus toxicity question of adjuvant therapies into context.\\nThe use of systemic therapy prior to surgery has become the mainstay of therapy for patients with\\nlocally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer but is increasingly being offered to patients with\\nearly-stage breast cancer to facilitate BCT instead of mastectomy.\\nFollow-Up Care\\nAfter primary treatment, breast cancer patients should be followed for life because of the long,\\ninsidious natural history of breast cancer. The goals of close breast cancer follow-up are to detect\\nrecurrences and second primaries after treatment in the ipsilateral breast and to detect new cancers in\\nthe contralateral breast. The risk of a second primary in the contralateral breast of a patient with a\\nhistory of breast cancer is believed to be roughly 0.5–1% per year. Although there are no universally\\naccepted guidelines, several consensus conferences have met to establish recommendations. After the\\ncompletion of treatment, it is recommended that the patient undergo a physical examination every 4\\nmonths for the first 2 years, then every 6 months until year 5, and annually thereafter. A mammogram\\nshould be obtained annually for all patients and no less than 6 months after the completion of\\nradiation therapy. For patients who received irradiation, a chest radiograph is also obtained yearly.\\nRoutine laboratory tests including CBC, chemistry profile, and LFTs can be ordered yearly, especially\\nif the patient received chemotherapy, or else as needed. There is no role for routine bone scans or\\nadditional imaging unless the patient is symptomatic or there is clinical suspicion of an abnormality.\\nPatients taking tamoxifen should have annual pelvic examinations and be counseled to report any\\nirregular vaginal bleeding. Patients on AIs need periodic bone density studies and lipid panels to\\nassess their cardiovascular risk factors.\\nA. Local Recurrence\\nThe development of local recurrence correlates with stage and thus tumor size as well as the presence\\nand number of positive axillary lymph nodes, margin status, nuclear grade, and histologic type. The\\nmedian time to recurrence is roughly 4 years, with a 1–2% risk per year for the first 5 years and a 1%\\nrisk per year thereafter. Late failures occurring 15–20 years or more after treatment, however, do\\noccur. The risk of local recurrence after BCT or MRM is generally <15%, 20 years after treatment.\\nPositive axillary lymph nodes are prognostic for local failure at the chest wall after MRM, but they\\nare not prognostic for a local failure after BCT.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='The treatment of local recurrences depends on the initial local therapy. In the breast, failures after\\nBCT can be treated with salvage mastectomy with salvage rates of approximately 50%. In general,\\nthere is no difference in overall survival for an isolated breast recurrence successfully treated with\\nsalvage mastectomy. Node failures are more ominous. Axillary failures have roughly a 50% 3- to 5-\\nyear disease-free survival, and supraclavicular failures have a 0–20% 3-year disease-free survival. All\\nchest wall abnormalities should be biopsied to rule out recurrence and resected with a wide local\\nexcision if possible. Adjuvant salvage therapies such as radiation, cytotoxic chemotherapy, and\\nhormonal therapy may also be instituted.\\nLocal recurrence may signal the presence of widespread disease and is an indication for bone and\\nliver scans, posteroanterior and lateral chest x-rays, and other examinations as needed to search for\\nevidence of distant metastases. When there is no evidence of metastases beyond the chest wall and\\nregional nodes, radical irradiation for cure and complete local excision can be attempted. Many\\npatients with locally recurrent tumors will develop distant metastases within 2 years. For this reason,\\nmost physicians use systemic therapy for treatment of patients with local recurrence.\\nB. Edema of the Arm\\nLymphedema of the arm is a significant and often dreaded complication of breast cancer treatment.\\nLymphedema occurs as a result of lymphatic disruption and insult caused primarily by local treatment\\nmodalities like surgery and radiation. Although each of these modalities carries its own risk with\\nrespect to arm edema, a combined-modality approach further increases this risk. With a typical level\\nI/II axillary lymph node dissection and radiation, the risk of lymphedema is roughly <10%. This risk\\napproached 30% when a more aggressive level III dissection was more commonly performed in the\\npast. The rates of clinically significant lymphedema—that is, edema that affects function and is not\\nmerely detectable with sophisticated measurement tools—are generally considered to be much lower.\\nWith the advent of SLNB, lymphedema rates are expected to continue to improve.\\nLate or secondary edema of the arm may develop years after MRM, as a result of axillary\\nrecurrence or of infection in the hand or arm, with obliteration of lymphatic channels. Interestingly,\\nthere is frequently no obvious initiating event causing late arm swelling in a patient with a history of\\nbreast cancer treatment.\\nC. Breast Reconstruction\\nBreast reconstruction, with the implantation of a prosthesis or autologous tissue such as transverse\\nrectus abdominis myocutaneous flap (TRAM), is now commonly offered following mastectomy and\\ncan be very frequently performed immediately after surgery. Therefore, reconstruction should be\\ndiscussed with patients prior to mastectomy and is not an obstacle to the diagnosis of recurrent cancer.\\nPrognosis\\nThe stage of breast cancer is the single most reliable indicator of prognosis. Patients with disease\\nlocalized to the breast and no evidence of regional spread after microscopic examination of the lymph\\nnodes have by far the most favorable prognosis. ERs and PRs appear to be an important prognostic\\nvariable because patients with hormone receptor–negative tumors and no evidence of metastases to\\nthe axillary lymph nodes have a much higher recurrence rate than do patients with hormone receptor-\\npositive tumors and no regional metastases. The histologic subtype of breast cancer (eg, medullary,\\nlobular, comedo) seems to have little significance in prognosis once these tumors are truly invasive.\\nMany patients who develop breast cancer will ultimately die of breast cancer.

Five-year statistics do not accurately reflect the final outcome of therapy.\\nWhen cancer is localized to the breast, with no evidence of regional spread after pathologic\\nexamination, the clinical cure rate with most accepted methods of therapy is 75–80%. Exceptions to\\nthis may be related to the hormonal receptor content of the tumor, tumor size, host resistance, or\\nassociated illness. Patients with small ER- and PR-positive tumors and no evidence of axillary spread\\nprobably have a 5-year survival rate of nearly 90%. When the axillary lymph nodes are involved with\\nthe tumor, the survival rate drops to 50–60% at 5 years, and probably to less than 25% at 10 years. In\\ngeneral, breast cancer appears to be somewhat more aggressive in younger than in older women,\\nwhich may be related to the fact that relatively fewer younger women have ER-positive tumors.\\nPALLIATIVE TREATMENT OF RECURRENT AND METASTATIC BREAST CANCER\\nThis section discusses palliative therapy of disseminated disease incurable by surgery (stage IV).\\nLocal Therapy\\nPatients with metastatic breast cancer are unlikely to be cured of their disease, and for many, the goals\\nof care shift from cure to palliation, symptom control, and improved quality of life. In general, local\\ntherapy, such as palliative radiotherapy or surgery when technically feasible, should be reserved for\\npatients in order to control their symptoms and minimize the risk of complications. As part of\\nmultimodality treatment, surgery for patients with metastatic breast cancer should be reserved for\\npatients with a good performance status, minimal organ involvement, prolonged disease-free interval,\\nor indolent disease growth when the likelihood of achieving complete resection of the tumor or\\nmetastasis is reasonable. A subset of these patients may achieve long-term survival as a result of\\nsurgery, although confirmatory data are still lacking. Palliative irradiation is also of value in the\\ntreatment of certain bone or soft tissue metastases to control pain or avoid pathologic fracture.\\nRadiotherapy is especially useful in the treatment of the isolated bony metastasis and chest wall\\nrecurrences.\\nHormonal Therapy\\nDisseminated disease may respond to prolonged endocrine therapy such as ovarian ablation or\\nadministration of drugs that block hormone receptor sites or that block hormone synthesis or\\nproduction. Hormonal manipulation is usually more successful in postmenopausal women. A\\nfavorable response to hormonal manipulation occurs in about one-third of patients with metastatic\\nbreast cancer. In patients whose tumors contain ERs, the response is approximately 60%, and perhaps\\nas high as 80% for patients whose tumors contain PRs as well. Tumors negative for both ERs and PRs\\nhave response rates to hormonal therapy that are 10% or less.\\nBecause the quality of life during a remission induced by endocrine manipulation is usually\\nsuperior to a remission after cytotoxic chemotherapy, it may be best to try \\nendocrine manipulation as\\na first-line systemic treatment for tumor recurrence or palliation. However, it is better to forgo\\nendocrine therapy in patients with rapidly growing visceral metastases in whom a period of ineffective\\ntherapy may lead to a significant decline in organ function and performance status. Thus, salvage\\nendocrine therapy is best reserved for patients with minimal symptoms, no visceral involvement, and\\nslow-growing tumors.\\nAs a general rule, only 1 type of systemic therapy should be given at a time. The systemic modality\\nmay be given in combination with a local or regional treatment if symptomatic lesions develop. For'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='instance, it may be necessary to irradiate a destructive lesion of weight-bearing bone while the patient\\nis taking a hormonal agent or chemotherapy. The palliative systemic regimen should be changed only\\nif the disease is clearly progressing but not if disease appears stable. This is especially important for\\npatients with destructive bone metastases, because minor changes in the status of these lesions are\\ndifficult to determine radiographically. A plan of therapy that would simultaneously minimize\\ntoxicity and maximize benefits is often best achieved by hormonal manipulation.\\nThe choice of endocrine therapy depends on the menopausal status of the patient. Women\\nwithin 1 year of their last menstrual period are considered to be premenopausal, whereas women\\nwhose menstruation ceased more than 1 year ago are usually classified as postmenopausal\\n. In the\\npast, ovarian ablation, usually by bilateral surgical oophorectomy, or radiation was the standard\\nmethod of hormone manipulation used in premenopausal women with advanced breast cancer.\\nHowever, it has subsequently become clear that tamoxifen is equally effective and has none of the\\nattendant risks of surgical ablation of the ovaries. Tamoxifen is recommended as the treatment of\\nchoice for hormonal therapy in the premenopausal woman with advanced breast cancer. For\\npostmenopausal patients, AIs and tamoxifen are the initial therapy of choice for metastatic breast\\ncancer amenable to endocrine manipulation, and a favorable response to initial hormonal therapy with\\ntamoxifen is predictive of future responses to hormonal maneuvers.\\nThe use of AIs, which work by blocking the conversion of testosterone to estradiol and\\nandrostenedione to estrogen both in the adrenal cortex and in peripheral tissue, including breast\\ncancers themselves, is effective in postmenopausal patients.\\nOther hormonal agents have been found to be effective in premenopausal patients. Gonadotropin-\\nreleasing hormone (GnRH) agonists that act on the pituitary to eventually suppress follicle-\\nstimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and the pituitary–ovarian axis, thereby\\ndecreasing estrogen production, have been used since the 1980s. They are an alternative to\\noophorectomy if used alone or can be combined with tamoxifen or AIs.\\nProgestins, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone acetate are alternative agents reserved\\nmainly for cases resistant to tamoxifen and AIs.\\nChemotherapy\\nCytotoxic drugs should be considered for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in the following\\ninstances: (1) if visceral metastases are present (especially brain or lymphangitic pulmonary spread),\\n(2) if hormonal treatment is unsuccessful or the disease has progressed after an initial response to\\nhormonal manipulation, or (3) if the tumor is ER and PR negative. With response rates of 35–55% in\\nmany series, the taxanes are quickly eclipsing the anthracyclines as the single most useful agents in\\nthe treatment of hormone-refractory metastatic breast cancer. Where once doxorubicin could achieve\\nresponse rates of 40–50%, in some trials, the taxanes seem to offer a small overall survival advantage.\\nIn addition, they are generally well tolerated with an acceptable side effect profile. Questions about\\ndosing, schedule of administration, and use with other agents, however, still have to be thoroughly\\nanswered.\\nCombination chemotherapy using multiple agents is appealing because, theoretically, the risk of\\ndrug resistance and cumulative toxicity is decreased. When compared to single-agent doxorubicin\\ntherapy, combination chemotherapy provides higher response rates and longer intervals until first\\nprogression. Nevertheless, the use of combination chemotherapy has never been shown to decrease\\ndrug resistance or toxicity in breast cancer. When combination chemotherapy has been compared to\\nsingle-agent taxane therapy, although response rates were slightly lower, quality-of-life measurements\\nwere higher for the single agent. Thus, either a single-agent taxane or an anthracycline-containing'),\n",

The use of cytotoxic chemotherapy\\nor any other treatment modality should always be highly individualized, especially in the palliative\\nsetting.\\nBisphosphonate Therapy\\nBone is the most common site of metastatic disease at initial presentation and at the time of breast\\ncancer recurrence. Bone metastases are often detected with a bone scan obtained in the staging of\\nlocally advanced cases or obtained because of clinical suspicion in the previously treated patient.\\nConfirmation with plain radiographs, MRI, and/or CT is frequently needed because nearly 10% of\\nlytic lesions may not be detected with a nuclear medicine scan.

Bernstein, MD, PhD George VanBuren, MD\\nNORMAL PREGNANCY\\nPregnancy\\n (gestation) is the physiologic process of a developing fetus within the maternal body.\\nSeveral terms are used to define the developmental stage of human conception and the duration of\\npregnancy. For obstetric purposes, the gestational age or menstrual age is the time elapsed since the\\nfirst day of the last normal menstrual period (LNMP), which actually precedes the time of oocyte\\nfertilization. The gestational age is expressed in completed weeks. The start of the gestation (based on\\nthe LNMP) is usually 2 weeks before ovulation, assuming a 28-day regular menstrual cycle. The\\ndevelopmental or fetal age is the age of the conception calculated from the time of implantation,\\nwhich is 4 to 6 days after ovulation is completed. The menstrual gestational age of pregnancy is\\ncalculated at 280 days or 40 completed weeks. The estimated due date (EDD) may be estimated by\\nadding 7 days to the first day of the last menstrual period and subtracting 3 months plus 1 year\\n(Naegele’s rule).\\nThe period of gestation can be divided into units consisting of 3 calendar months each or 3\\ntrimesters. The first trimester can be subdivided into the embryonic and fetal periods. The embryonic\\nperiod starts at the time of fertilization (developmental age) or at 2 through 10 weeks’ gestational age.\\nThe embryonic period is the stage at which organogenesis occurs and the time period during which the\\nembryo is most sensitive to teratogens. The end of the embryonic period and the beginning of the fetal\\nperiod occurs 8 weeks after fertilization (developmental age) or 10 weeks after the onset of the last\\nmenstrual period.\\nDefinitions\\nThe term \\ngravid\\n means “pregnant”; gravida is the total number of pregnancies that a women has had,\\nregardless of the outcome. \\nParity\\n is the number of births, both before and after 20 weeks’ gestation,\\nand comprises 4 components:\\n1. Full-term births\\n2. Preterm births: having given birth to an infant (alive or deceased) weighing 500 g or more, or at or\\nbeyond 20 completed weeks (based on the first day of the last menstrual period)\\n3. Abortions: pregnancies ending before 20 weeks, either induced or spontaneous\\n4. Living children\\nWhen gravidity and parity are calculated as part of the obstetric history, multiple births are\\ndesignated as a single gravid event, and each infant is included as part of the parity total.\\nLive birth\\n is the delivery of any infant (regardless of gestational age) that demonstrates evidence\\nof life (eg, a heartbeat, umbilical cord pulsation, voluntary or involuntary movement), independent of\\nwhether the umbilical cord has been cut or the placenta detached. An \\ninfant\\n is a live-born human from\\nthe moment of birth until the completion of 1 year of life (365 days).'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='A \\npreterm infant\\n is defined as one born between 20 weeks and 37 completed weeks of gestation\\n(259 days). A \\nterm infant\\n is one born between 37 0/7 and 40 0/7 weeks gestation (280 days). At term,\\na fetus usually weighs more than 2500 g. Depending on maternal factors such as obesity and diabetes,\\namniotic fluid volume, and genetic and racial factors, the baby may be larger or smaller than\\nexpected; therefore, the clinician must rely on objective data to determine fetal maturity. Fetal lung\\nmaturity is assumed after 39 weeks’ gestation but can be verified at an earlier gestational age by\\nanalysis of amniotic fluid by amniocentesis.\\nA \\npostterm infant\\n is born after 42 weeks’ gestation (294 days). A prolonged pregnancy may result\\nin an excessive-size infant with diminished placental capacity. A postmature infant may exhibit\\ncharacteristic cutaneous changes, including a loss of subcutaneous fat, wrinkled skin, and fine long\\nhair on the arms. Predicting the end of a pregnancy is a difficult problem for prenatal care providers.\\nPrenatal mortality rates increase as gestation advances past the due date (EDD) and accelerates\\nsharply after 42 weeks’ gestation. It is not uncommon to offer induction of labor after 41 completed\\nweeks, or 7 days past the due date. (See \\nChapter 14\\n on Late Pregnancy Complications.) Estimated\\ngestational age can be determined by methods outlined later for ascertaining fetal age and EDD.\\nIncreased morbidity and mortality may be associated with a \\nmacrosomic infant\\n or a \\nlarge for\\ngestational age\\n (LGA) fetus. This is defined as a fetus with an estimated fetal weight at or beyond the\\n90th percentile at any gestational age. At term, approximately 10% of newborn infants weigh more\\nthan 4000 g, and the weight of 1.5% of newborns is in excess of 4500 g. Excessive fetal size should be\\nsuspected in women with a previous macrosomic fetus or those with diabetes mellitus. A \\nlow-birth-\\nweight infant\\n is any live birth for which the infant’s weight is less than or equal to 2500 g. An infant\\nwith fetal growth restriction is defined as one at or below the 10th percentile at any gestational age.\\nUsing a system based on the duration of gestational age or fetal weight, an \\nabortion\\n is the\\nexpulsion or extraction of part (incomplete) or all (complete) of the placenta or membranes without an\\nidentified fetus or with a fetus (alive or deceased) weighing less than 500 g or with an estimated\\ngestational age of less than 20 completed weeks or 139 days from the last menstrual period, if fetal\\nweight is unknown.\\nA. Birth Rate & Fertility Rate\\nBirth rate\\n is defined as the number of live births per 1000 population. The \\nfertility rate\\n is expressed\\nas the number of live births per 1000 women ages 15–44 years (sexually active population group). The\\ncurrent birth rate is 13.83 per 1000 population in 2010, whereas the general fertility rate is 66.7 per\\n1000 women ages 15–44 years.\\nB. Neonatal & Perinatal Periods\\nThe \\nneonatal\\n period is defined as birth until 28 days of life; during this interval, the infant is\\ndesignated as a newborn or neonate. The \\nperinatal period\\n is the time from 28 weeks’ gestation to the\\nfirst 7 days of life; this also includes the late fetal and early neonatal period.\\nThe \\nprenatal mortality rate\\n is the sum of late fetal deaths plus early neonatal deaths (death in the\\nfirst 7 days of life). The \\nneonatal mortality rate\\n (NMR) is infant death from birth to within 28 days\\nof life. The NMR is calculated as the number of neonatal deaths during a year, divided by the number\\nof live births during the same year, expressed per 1000 live births.\\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Accessed\\nJanuary 10, 2011.\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n Diagnosis is made on the basis of amenorrhea and a positive pregnancy test.\\n It is crucial to diagnose pregnancy as soon as possible in order to initiate appropriate prenatal care,\\navoid teratogen (an agent that can cause a deleterious fetal effect) exposure, and diagnose nonviable\\nor ectopic pregnancies.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms & Signs\\nA number of clinical signs and symptoms may presumptively indicate pregnancy.\\n1. Amenorrhea\\n—Cessation of menses is caused by hormones (estrogen and progesterone) produced\\nby the corpus luteum. The abrupt cessation of menses in a healthy reproductive-aged female with\\npredictable cycles is highly suggestive of pregnancy.\\n2. Nausea & vomiting\\n—This is a common symptom (50% of pregnancies) that begins as early as 2\\nweeks’ gestational age and customarily resolves at between 13 and 16 weeks’ gestation. Hyperemesis\\ngravidarum is an extreme form of nausea and vomiting and is characterized by dehydration, weight\\nloss (up to 5%), and ketonuria. In extreme cases of hyperemesis gravidarum, hospitalization,\\nintravenous therapy, antiemetics, and, if needed, parenteral nutrition are given. Uncomplicated nausea\\nand vomiting is treated with frequent small meals, a dry diet, and emotional support. (See \\nChapter 29\\non Gastrointestinal Disorders in Pregnancy for more discussion.)\\n3. Breast changes\\nA\\n. M\\nASTODYNIA\\n—Breast tenderness may range from tingling to pain caused by hormonal changes\\naffecting the mammary duct and alveolar system.\\nB\\n. B\\nREAST ENGORGEMENT\\n—Breast engorgement and periareolar venous prominences are also seen\\nearly in pregnancy, especially in primiparous patients. \\nMontgomery’s tubercles\\n are the portion of the\\nareolar glands visible on the skin surface. These tubercles can be more pronounced during pregnancy\\nsecondary to hormonal changes occurring as early as 6–8 weeks’ gestation.\\nC\\n. C\\nOLOSTRUM SECRETION\\n—Protein and antibody production may occur during pregnancy as early as\\n16 weeks’ gestation. This secretion is not associated with preterm delivery.\\nD\\n. D\\nEVELOPMENT OF SECONDARY BREAST TISSUE\\n—Development of secondary breast tissue may occur\\nacross the nipple line. Hypertrophy of secondary breast tissue may occur in the axilla and cause a\\nsymptomatic mass.\\n4. Fetal movement\\n—The initial perception of fetal movement occurs at 18–20 weeks’ gestation in'),\n",

Maternal perception\\nof movement is called \\nquickening\\n, but this is not a dependable sign of pregnancy.\\n5. Elevated basal body temperature\\n—Progesterone produces a 0.5°F increase in the basal body\\ntemperature, which persists after the missed menses. The rise in temperature occurs within the luteal\\nphase of the menstrual cycle.\\n6. Skin changes\\nA\\n. C\\nHLOASMA\\n—The mask of pregnancy is skin darkening of the forehead, bridge of the nose, or cheek\\nbones. This pregnancy-associated change is linked to genetic predisposition and usually occurs after\\n16 weeks’ gestation. Chloasma is exacerbated by sunlight.\\nB\\n. L\\nINEA NIGRA\\n—Melanocyte-stimulating hormone increases, causing darkening of the nipples and\\nthe lower midline from the umbilicus to the pubis (linea nigra). This skin change is genetically based;\\nskin lightens slightly after delivery of the fetus.\\nC\\n. S\\nTRIAE\\n—Striae marks of the breast and abdomen appear as irregular scars. The striae appear late in\\npregnancy and are caused by collagen separation.\\nD\\n. S\\nPIDER TELANGIECTASIA\\n—These are common skin lesions of pregnancy that result from elevated\\nplasma estrogen. Both the vascular stellate skin lesions as well as palmar erythema may be seen in\\npregnancy and also occur in patients with liver failure.\\n7. Pelvic organ changes\\nA\\n. C\\nHADWICK’S SIGN\\n—Congestion of the pelvic vasculature causes bluish discoloration of the vagina\\nand the cervix. This is a presumptive sign of pregnancy.\\nB\\n. H\\nEGAR’S SIGN\\n—There is widening and softening of the body or isthmus of the uterus. This occurs at\\n6–8 weeks’ menstrual age or gestational age. Estrogen and progesterone cause increased cervical\\nsoftening and dilation at the external os.\\nC\\n. L\\nEUKORRHEA\\n—There is an increase in vaginal discharge, containing epithelial cells and cervical\\nmucous, secondary to hormonal changes.\\nD\\n. P\\nELVIC LIGAMENTS\\n—There is relaxation of the sacroiliac and pubic symphysis during pregnancy.\\nRelaxation is pronounced at the pelvic symphysis.\\nE\\n. A\\nBDOMINAL ENLARGEMENT\\n—There is progressive abdominal enlargement with growth of uterus\\nduring pregnancy. From 18 to 34 weeks there is a good correlation between the uterine fundal\\nmeasurement in centimeters and the gestational age in weeks.\\nF\\n. U\\nTERINE CONTRACTIONS\\n—Painless uterine contractions (\\nBraxton Hick’s contractions\\n) are felt as\\ntightening or pressure. They usually begin at approximately 28 weeks’ gestation and increase in\\nregularity with advancing gestational age. These contractions usually disappear with walking or\\nexercise, whereas true labor contractions become more intense.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='DIAGNOSIS\\nA. Fetal Heart Tones\\nFetal heart tones (FHTs) are detectable by handheld Doppler (after 10 weeks’ gestation) or by\\nfetoscope (after 18–20 weeks’ gestation). The normal heart rate is 110–160 beats per minute, with a\\nhigher fetal heart rate observed early in pregnancy.\\nB. Uterine Size/Fetal Palpation\\nUterine size can be used to diagnose pregnancy secondary to uterine enlargement. Later in pregnancy,\\nthe fetus can be palpated through the maternal abdominal wall (after 22 weeks), and the position can\\nbe determined by Leopold’s maneuvers.\\nC. Imaging Studies\\nSonography is one of the most useful technical aids in diagnosing and monitoring pregnancy. Cardiac\\nactivity is discernible at 5–6 weeks via transvaginal sonogram, limb buds at 7–8 weeks, and finger and\\nlimb movements at 9–10 weeks. At the end of the embryonic period (10 weeks by LNMP), the embryo\\nhas a human appearance. The gestational age can be determined by the crown rump length between 6\\nand 13 weeks’ gestation, with a margin of error of approximately 8% or 3–5 days.\\nD. Pregnancy Tests\\nSensitive, early pregnancy tests measure changes in the level of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).\\nThere is a small degree of cross-reactivity between luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone,\\nand thyrotropin, which all share an α subunit with hCG. The β submit of hCG is produced by the\\nsyncytiotrophoblast 8 days after fertilization and may be detected in the maternal serum 8–11 days\\nafter conception or as early as 21–22 days after the LNMP. β-hCG levels peak at 10–12 weeks’\\ngestation and decrease afterward. The half-life of hCG is 1.5 days. Generally, serum and urine levels\\nreturn to normal (<5 mIU/mL), 21–24 days after delivery or after a fetal loss.\\n1. Home pregnancy test\\n—hCG is a qualitative test that is performed on the first voided morning\\nurine sample. \\nA positive test is usually indicated by a color change. Because the accuracy of the home\\npregnancy test depends on technique and interpretation, it should always be repeated in the office.\\n2. Urine pregnancy test\\n—An antibody assay recognizing the β-hCG subunit is the initial lab test\\nperformed in the office to diagnose pregnancy. The test is reliable, rapid (1–5 minutes), and\\ninexpensive, with a positive test threshold between 5 and 50 mIU/mL, characterized by a color change.\\nThis is the most common method to confirm pregnancy.\\n3. Serum pregnancy test—\\nβ-hCG can be detected within 7 days after conception or at a menstrual\\nage of 21 days’ gestation. The threshold for a positive test can be as low as 2–4 mIU/mL. Serial\\nquantitative tests of β-hCG are be used to evaluate threatened abortion, ectopic pregnancy, or a molar\\npregnancy.\\nGESTATIONAL AGE DETERMINATION\\nThe EDD (estimated date of delivery) and gestational age should be established based on the LNMP\\nand Naegele’s rule.

From 13 to 20 weeks, the most accurate parameter for\\ngestational age assessment is the biparietal diameter, although this measurement is often used\\ntogether with the head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length, with a margin of\\nerror (secondary to measurement) of 8% or approximately 7 days.

Cervical length assessment.\\n5. Fetal well-being can be monitored by ultrasound using the biophysical profile.\\nUterine Size\\nAn early first-trimester examination usually correlates well with the estimated gestational age. The\\nuterus is palpable just at the pubic symphysis at 8 weeks. At 12 weeks, the uterus becomes an\\nabdominal organ, and at 16 weeks, it is usually at the midpoint between the pubic symphysis and the\\numbilicus. Between 18 and 34 weeks’ gestation, the uterus size or fundal height is measured in\\ncentimeters from the pubic symphysis to the upper edge of the uterine corpus, and the measurement\\ncorrelates well with the gestational age in weeks (\\nFig. 6–1\\n).

During the\\nmedical evaluation, the risks of cigarette smoking, alcohol and drug use, and exposure to known\\nteratogens are discussed. Instructions on nutrition, exercise, and vitamins can be provided before\\npregnancy. For example, folic acid taken 3 months before conception may be beneficial in decreasing\\nthe incidence of open neural tube defects and cardiac anomalies.\\nMost women do not have a preconception evaluation, and the first prenatal visit may be scheduled\\nwell into the first and occasionally in the second or third trimester.

Obstetric History\\nThe interview should include a discussion of current symptoms; this is also an ideal time to discuss\\nany perceptions regarding childbearing (including potential birth plans) and the effect of the\\npregnancy on the patient’s life.\\nOutcomes of all previous pregnancies provide important information for the current pregnancy; the\\nfollowing information should be obtained: length of gestation, birth weight, length of labor, type of\\ndelivery, fetal/neonatal outcome, anesthesia, and any complications occurring in previous\\npregnancies, including pregnancies ending before 20 weeks’ gestation. If a caesarean section was\\nperformed, an operative report detailing the type of incision and any intraoperative complications\\nshould be obtained.\\nB. Medical History\\nPregnancy may influence a number of maternal organ systems, and preexisting conditions may be\\nexacerbated during pregnancy. Many cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and endocrine disorders require\\ncareful evaluation and consultation regarding effects on the mother. For example, a prior blood\\ntransfusion may increase the risk of hemolytic disease of the newborn because of maternal antibodies\\nproduced secondary to a minor blood group mismatch.

Family History\\nA family history of diabetes mellitus should alert the clinician about an increased risk of gestational\\ndiabetes, especially if the patient has a history of a large infant or a previous birth defect, or an\\nunexplained fetal demise. Glucose testing should be performed at the initial prenatal visit if there is a\\nstrong suspicion of undiagnosed pregestational diabetes rather than waiting until 24–28 weeks’\\ngestation.\\nAwareness of familial disorders is also important in pregnancy management. Thus a brief, 3-\\ngeneration pedigree is useful. Antenatal screening tests are available for many hereditary diseases. A\\nhistory of twinning is important, because dizygotic twinning (polyovulation) may be a maternally\\ninherited trait.\\nE.

The shape of the outlet can be determined by palpitation of the pubic rami from the\\nsymphysis to the ischial tuberosities with an estimation of the angle of the rami. A subpubic angle of\\nless than 90 degrees suggests an inadequate pelvic outlet. A prominent coccyx decreases the anterior\\nposterior diameter of the outlet and may further diminish the pelvic outlet.\\n2. Uterus\\n—The uterus can be used to confirm gestational age in the first half of pregnancy. As the\\nuterus enlarges, it becomes globular and often rotates to the right.\\n3. Cervical length\\n—A nulliparous woman who has not undergone a vaginal delivery will have a\\nclosed external cervical os. A multiparous patient may have a greater opening or dilation of the\\nexternal os. The average cervical length by bimanual examination in women averages between 3 and 4\\ncm. Women with a previous history of spontaneous preterm \\nbirth may undergo a transvaginal\\nsonogram (TVS) during the second trimester to evaluate her risk of recurrent preterm birth. Serial\\nTVS exams may be necessary if there is any evidence of cervical dilation or cervical shortening on the\\ninitial sonogram.\\n4. Adnexal exam\\n—During the pelvic exam, a bimanual examination is performed, and the cervical\\nlength and evaluation of both ovaries (the adnexa) can be performed.\\nLaboratory Tests\\nA. Initial Blood Tests\\nAt the first prenatal visit, a number of screening tests are performed, including a complete blood count\\n(hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets), blood group and Rh typing (ABO/Rh), screen for antibodies\\nagainst blood group antigens, VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Laboratory) or RPR (rapid plasma\\nreagent) for syphilis, hepatitis B surface antigen, and serology to detect antibodies against rubella and\\nHIV. Women with a history of gestational diabetes are given a glucose challenge test (GCT) with oral\\ningestion of a solution containing 50 g of glucose. The venous glucose level is checked 1 hour after\\nglucose ingestion.\\nB. Genetic Screening and Testing\\n1. Screening\\n—First-trimester screening using a combination of a fetal nuchal translucency\\nmeasurement and maternal serum analysis of pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) and\\nfree or total β-hCG is used to screen for trisomy (21, 18, and 13). The detection rate of aneuploidy is\\nbetween 85% and 87%, with a false-positive rate of less than 5%. With the use of first-trimester\\nscreening, maternal serum α fetoprotein (AFP) should be drawn at 15–18 weeks’ gestation to screen\\nfor open neural tube defects.\\nFor patients desiring aneuploidy assessment who did not receive first-trimester screening, a second\\ntrimester maternal serum quad screen is offered between 15 and 20 weeks’ gestation (ideally at 16–18\\nweeks) to screen for neural tube defects and aneuploidy (chromosomal abnormalities). Analytes\\nstudied include serum β-hCG, unconjugated estriol, AFP, and inhibin. The detection rate of a quad\\nscreen is between 65% and 75% for trisomy 21, 18, and 13 and between 80% and 85% for open neural\\ntube defects. The false-positive rate is approximately 5%.\\nAdditional genetic testing includes hemoglobin electrophoresis to screen for hemoglobinopathies'),\n",

Invasive genetic testing\\n—Invasive genetic testing must be offered to all women, especially those\\nwho will be 35 years of age or older at the time of delivery or who have a history of an abnormal\\npedigree or risk factors for inherited diseases. Chorionic villous sampling is performed between 9 and\\n13 weeks’ gestation by either transabdominal or transvaginal technique. Amniocentesis is usually\\noffered at between 15 and 20 weeks’ gestation. The complication rate of these procedures is less than\\n1%, and the detection rate for aneuploidy is greater than 99%.\\nC. Urine Testing\\nAt the initial prenatal visit, urinalysis and culture is performed. Approximately 2–12% of pregnant\\nwomen have an asymptomatic urinary tract infection. If the bacterial count is greater than 10\\n5\\n/mL,\\nexpressed as colony-forming units (CFU) on a voided specimen, then antibiotic sensitivity is\\nperformed.\\nTesting for urinary protein, glucose, and ketones is performed at each prenatal visit. Proteinuria of\\ngreater than or equal to 2+ on a standard dipstick (which correlates to greater than 300 mg/24 hours on\\na timed urine collection) may indicate renal disease or the onset of preeclampsia. The presence of\\nglucosuria signifies that glucose transport to the kidney exceeds the transport capacity of the kidneys.\\nThis generally does not have clinical significance unless carbohydrate intolerance or gestational\\ndiabetes is present. During pregnancy in a known diabetic patient, the presence of urinary ketones\\nusually indicates inadequate carbohydrate intake. In this case, the patient’s diet should be reevaluated\\nto ensure adequate carbohydrate intake.\\nD. Papanicolaou Smear (PAP)\\nCervical cancer screening is performed at the initial prenatal visit unless there has been a normal\\nexam within the past year.\\nE. Tuberculin Skin Test\\nA tuberculin skin test (\\npurified protein derivative\\n) is appropriate for high-risk patients.\\nE. Sexually Transmitted Diseases\\n1. Syphilis\\n—Tests performed at the initial prenatal visit such as VDRL and the RPR screen in a\\nsensitive, nonspecific manner for \\nTreponema pallidum\\n. A treponemal antibody test (FTA-ABS) is\\nused to confirm syphilis infection after a positive VDRL or RPR screen in the absence of confirmed\\nprior infection. Penicillin is the treatment of choice in pregnancy because of the ability of the agent to\\ncross the placenta and treat the fetus as well as the mother. Erythromycin or ceftriaxone are\\nalternative treatments outside of pregnancy, but penicillin is the treatment of choice for pregnant\\nwomen. Because of the risk of treatment failure with secondary agents and congenital syphilis\\ninfection, penicillin desensitization is indicated in the setting of anaphylactic allergy. Monthly\\nserologic tests (VDRL or RPR) are followed to assess treatment success of syphilis. These tests can\\nremain positive after treatment; however, their titer should decrease substantially. The FTA-ABS will\\nremain positive even after successful treatment.\\n2. Chlamydia\\n—Screening consists of a DNA probe, which has a 90% specificity and sensitivity.

Herpes simplex virus\\n—Tissue culture or DNA polymerase chain reaction are used to detect active\\nherpetic infections; serology can be used to assess a history of exposure. Oral acyclovir is used for\\nprimary and recurrent outbreaks. Prophylactic treatment at 36 weeks’ gestation for women with\\ndocumented genital herpes and recurrent outbreaks is recommended to reduce the chance of the\\npatient having an active outbreak when she presents in labor. Regimens commonly used are acyclovir\\n400 mg twice daily or valacyclovir 1000 mg daily. When a patient is admitted for delivery, she should\\nbe asked about prodromal symptoms and examined for lesions of the cervix, vagina, and perineum. If\\nno lesions or symptoms are present, vaginal delivery is permitted.\\n5. HIV\\n—All obstetric patients should undergo HIV screening on an “opt out” basis at the first\\nprenatal visit. The initial HIV screening test is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)\\nfollowed by a confirmatory Western blot or immunofluorescence assay for patients with ELISA-\\npositive tests.\\nIf a woman has not had prenatal HIV testing (or care), a rapid HIV test is offered at the time of\\nhospital admission. The goal of prenatal care and treatment of the HIV-positive pregnant patient is to\\nappropriately treat the mother, reduce viral load, and minimize perinatal HIV transmission by\\nproviding antiretroviral prophylaxis intrapartum and to the infant. Treatment regimens should include\\nprenatal highly active anti-retroviral therapy and intrapartum infusion of azidothymidine. Ongoing\\nassessment of an HIV-infected pregnant woman involves serial measurements of the viral load and\\nCD4 T-cell count. Cesarean delivery is recommended only for patients with high viral load (>1000\\ncopies/mL); otherwise, mode of delivery is dictated by obstetric indications.\\n6. Other infections\\nA\\n. T\\nRICHOMONAS\\n—\\nTrichomonas vaginalis\\n can be identified in 20–30% of pregnant patients, but only\\n5–10% \\nof patients are symptomatic (itching, burning, or discharge). \\nT vaginalis\\n is a flagellated ovoid\\norganism seen under magnification in warm normal saline solution. The discharge is described as\\nfoamy green and malodorous. Metronidazole has an efficacy of approximately 95% against \\nT\\nvaginalis\\n. Metronidazole may be given as a single oral dose of 2 g, 500 mg twice daily for 7 days, or\\n250 mg 3 times daily for 7 days.\\nB\\n. C\\nANDIDIASIS\\n—\\nCandida albicans\\n can be cultured from the vagina of many immunocompromised\\nwomen (HIV, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, or pregnant).

In refractory cases,\\nadministration of systemic agents may be considered. Fluconazole (150-mg single oral dose) is the\\npreferred agent in pregnancy.\\nC\\n. B\\nACTERIAL VAGINOSIS\\n—Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is responsible for a large percentage of vaginitis\\nduring pregnancy. BV is a polymicrobial infection that is associated with many complications of\\npregnancy, including preterm labor, preterm premature rupture of membranes, chorioamnionitis, and\\nendometritis.\\nSUBSEQUENT VISITS\\nThe frequency of office visits is dependent on the gestational age, maternal condition, and any fetal\\ncomplications. The standard schedule for prenatal office visits in uncomplicated patients is every 4\\nweeks from 0 to 32 weeks’ gestation, every 2 weeks from 32 to 36 weeks’ gestation, and weekly visits\\nafter 36 weeks’ gestation.\\nAt each visit, maternal weight, uterine fundal height, maternal blood pressure, and urinalysis by\\ndipstick are documented. The FHTs should be documented. All findings should be recorded and\\ncompared with those from previous visits.\\nMaternal Weight Gain\\nThe prepregnancy weight and the amount of weight gain during pregnancy are important. Maternal\\nweight gain during pregnancy is due to a number of factors. The fetus (on average, 3500 g at term), the\\nplacenta (650 g) amniotic fluid (800 mg), breast enlargement (400 g) and uterus (970 g) are factors, as\\nwell as increased interstitial fluid and blood volume, which results in an additional 1200–1800 g of\\nweight gain.\\nA woman who is 15% or more below ideal body weight or of short stature has a risk for a small for\\ngestational age (SGA) infant and preterm delivery. A pregnant adolescent may have maternal\\ncompromise, as well as fetal jeopardy, if her diet is inadequate to meet her own growth requirements\\nas well as that of the fetus. Inadequate maternal weight gain may reflect poor nutrition, inadequate\\nnutrition absorption, or maternal illness, predisposing the mother to an inadequate volume expansion\\nand the fetus to growth restriction. The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology recommend a\\nweight gain of 11.5–16 kg (25–35 lb) during a singleton pregnancy. Underweight women should gain\\nmore weight (12.5–18 kg or 28–40 lb), whereas obese women should gain less than 7–11.5 kg or 15–\\n25 lbs.\\nObese women (>30 body mass index [BMI]) and those with excessive maternal weight gain during\\npregnancy are more likely to have a macrosomic infant when compared with women with a normal\\nBMI and appropriate weight gain during pregnancy.\\nBlood Pressure\\nThe blood pressure tends to decrease 5–7 mm (both systolic and diastolic components) early in the\\nsecond trimester, but the blood pressure measurement returns to normal levels in the third trimester.\\nBlood pressure changes may provide a subtle sign of vascular compromise. Elevation of blood\\npressure may precede an increase in proteinuria seen with hypertension in pregnancy. Blood pressure\\nis most accurately measured in a sitting position (with the arm at the level of the heart).'),\n",

Measurement is made from the pubic symphysis to the top of the\\nuterus (McDonald’s technique). Fundal height is measured at each visit after 20 weeks’ gestation. If\\nthe fundal height is discordant from the estimated gestational age by more than 2 (centimeters or\\nweeks), further evaluation of fetal size and amniotic fluid via ultrasound is warranted.\\nFetal Heart Tones\\nFHTs can be auscultated by 10–12 weeks’ gestation using a handheld Doppler device; while in use,\\nattention should be paid to the rate, rhythm, and presence of any irregularity of heart rate, as well as\\naccelerations or decelerations. Abnormalities in rate or rhythm should be evaluated by ultrasound,\\nelectronic fetal heart rate monitoring, or even a fetal echocardiogram.\\nEdema\\nAt each prenatal visit, findings should be noted, including transient episodes of general edema or\\nswelling. \\nLower extremity edema in late pregnancy is a natural consequence of hydrostatic changes in\\nlower body circulation. Edema of the upper body (eg, face and hands), especially in association with\\nrelative or absolute increases in blood pressure, may be the first sign of preeclampsia, although edema\\nis not part of the current diagnostic criteria. A moderate rise in blood pressure without excessive fluid\\nretention may suggest a predisposition to chronic hypertension.\\nFetal Size & Position\\nManual assessment of fetal size and position is always indicated after approximately 26 weeks’\\ngestation. The fetus may assume a number of positions before late gestation, but persistence of an\\nabnormal lie into late pregnancy suggests abnormal placentation, uterine anomalies, or other problems\\nthat should be investigated by ultrasound. If an abnormal lie persists, consider external version after\\n37 weeks’ gestation.\\nLaboratory Evaluations\\nA. Third-Trimester Laboratory Studies\\n1. Gestational diabetes screening\\n—A 1-hour GCT, with a 50-g glucose load, is given between 24 and\\n28 weeks’ gestation. If the 1-hour glucose test is abnormal, a 3-hour glucose tolerance test is\\nperformed. A 100-g glucose load is ingested after obtaining a fasting glucose level. Venous glucose\\nlevels are then measured at 1, 2, and 3 hours after the glucose load.\\n2. Complete blood count\\n—This is normally repeated at the beginning of the third trimester to\\nevaluate for anemia.\\n3. Group B streptococcus\\n—The current recommendation is to perform routine screening for group B\\nstreptococcus (GBS) between 35 and 37 weeks’ gestation. If the patient has a positive GBS culture at\\n35–37 weeks, or a positive urine culture for GBS anytime during the pregnancy, the patient is treated\\nwith penicillin (the drug of choice in the absence of allergy) at the time of admission in labor,\\ndecreasing the risk of early-onset group B streptococcal sepsis in the newborn.\\nCOMMON COMPLAINTS'),\n",

The cause is\\nunknown but may be associated with nausea and vomiting.\\nPica\\nPica is the ingestion of substances with no nutritive value; some common examples are ingestion of\\nclay or laundry starch. Pica is harmful, as nutrition may be inadequate with the ingestion of\\nnonnutritious bulk.\\nUrinary Frequency & Renal Function\\nUrinary frequency is a common complaint throughout pregnancy. Late in pregnancy, the enlarging\\nuterus and fetus decrease bladder capacity, leading to frequency. The glomerular filtration rate\\nincreases 50% during pregnancy, and the serum creatinine decreases to a level of 0.4–0.6 mg/dL. Both\\nthe altered bladder and kidney function result from hormonal changes associated with pregnancy.\\nDysuria or hematuria may be a sign of infection. Approximately 2–12% of pregnant women have a\\nurinary tract infection without symptoms. Diagnosis of a urinary tract infection will require a\\nurinalysis as well as a urine culture with bacterial sensitivity.\\nVaricose Veins\\nPressure by the enlarging uterus, which reduces venous return, as well as the relaxation of vascular\\nsmooth muscle by progesterone may result in enlargement of the peripheral veins in the lower\\nextremities and development of varicosities. Specific therapy includes elevation of the lower\\nextremities and the use of thigh-high compression stockings. These measures may reduce the degree\\nof lower extremity edema and varicosity. Superficial varicosity is not evidence of deepvenous\\nthrombosis.\\nJoint & Back Pain\\nDuring pregnancy, relaxation may result in a small degree of separation or mobility at the pubic\\nsymphysis and sacroiliac articulations. The pregnant patient may experience an unstable pelvis, which\\nresults in pain. A pelvic girdle or maternity sling with bed rest may partially relieve the pelvic pain.\\nThe increasingly protuberant maternal abdomen results in lordosis. The patient may compensate the\\nlordosis with backward thrust of the shoulders and forward thrust of the head. The corrective position\\nmay result in an exaggerated curvature of the maternal spine. A maternity girdle and low-heeled\\nsupport shoes may reduce the back pain.

It affects at least 5% of pregnant women. In some cases it is thought to be a brachial\\nplexus traction syndrome caused by drooping of the shoulders during pregnancy; carpal tunnel\\nsyndrome is a common cause of a similar symptom complex. The discomfort is most common at night\\nand early in the morning. It may progress to partial anesthesia and impairment of manual\\nproprioception. The condition is apparently not serious, but it may persist after delivery as a\\nconsequence of lifting and carrying the baby.\\nOTHER ISSUES RELATED TO PRENATAL CARE\\nBathing\\nBath water generally does not enter the vagina. Swimming and bathing are not contraindicated during\\npregnancy. However, in the third trimester, a patient may have impaired balance and is at risk for a\\nfall.\\nDental Care\\nThere may be gum hypertrophy and gingival bleeding during pregnancy. Interdental papillae (epulis)\\nmay form in the upper gingiva and may have to be surgically removed. Normal dental procedures such\\nas prophylaxis (cleaning), cavity restoration (filling), and periodontal restoration may be performed\\nunder local anesthesia. Antibiotics may be given for dental abscesses. Periodontal disease has been\\nassociated with an increased risk of preterm delivery in some studies.\\nDouching\\nDouching, which is seldom necessary, may be harmful during pregnancy and should be avoided.\\nDrugs, Nicotine, & Alcohol\\n1. Drugs\\n—A \\nteratogen\\n is a toxin, drug, or a biologic agent that causes a harmful effect on a fetus.\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has a classification system for drugs during pregnancy and\\nlactation. The greatest effect of a drug is normally during the period of organogenesis (weeks 2–10\\nafter LNMP). Drugs with the potential for addiction such as heroin, methadone, and benzodiazepines\\ncan cause major problems for the neonate, including withdrawal.\\n2. Nicotine & cigarette smoking\\n—There is an increased risk of low-birth-weight infants with\\ncigarette smoking by pregnant women. Smoking during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk\\nof intrauterine growth restriction, placenta previa, placenta abruption, preterm birth, low birth weight,\\nand perinatal mortality. Pregnant women should be urged not to smoke; but, if cessation is not\\npossible, a reduction of the number of cigarettes smoked per day is encouraged. Pharmacologic agents\\nmay be offered to assist with smoking cessation.\\n3. Alcohol\\n—The precise level of alcohol consumption that is safe during pregnancy cannot be\\ndetermined. A fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) after maternal ingestion (>2 oz daily) has been described,\\nwith an incidence from 1 in 600 to 1 in 1500 live births. The major features of FAS include pre- and\\npostnatal growth restriction, cranial–facial dysmorphology (including microcephalus and\\nmicrophthalmia), mental retardation, cardiac defects, and behavioral abnormalities.

Aerobic and\\nexercise classes have been designed for pregnant women. Pregnancy yoga classes are also available\\nfor women. Routines in yoga classes are designed for flexibility and joint protection.\\nImmunization\\nKilled virus, toxoid, or recombinant vaccines may be given during pregnancy. The American College\\nof Obstetrics and Gynecology recommends that all pregnant women should receive the injectable\\ninfluenza vaccine during the season (October–March). The “flu shot” is safe when given in any\\ntrimester. Furthermore, if administered during pregnancy, the vaccine appears to reduce the risk of\\ninfant respiratory disease within the first 6 months of life. Diphtheria and tetanus toxoid, hepatitis B\\nvaccine series, and killed polio vaccine may be administered during pregnancy to women at risk.\\nLive attenuated vaccines (varicella, measles, mumps, polio, and rubella) should be given 3 months\\nbefore pregnancy or postpartum. Live virus vaccines are contra-indicated in pregnancy secondary to\\nthe potential risk of fetal infection. Viral shedding occurs in children receiving vaccination, but they\\ndo not transmit the virus; consequently, vaccination may be safely given to the children of pregnant\\nwomen.\\nSecondary prophylaxis with immune globulin is recommended for pregnant women exposed to\\nmeasles, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, tetanus, chicken pox, or rabies.\\nIntercourse\\nNo adverse outcome can be directly attributed to sexual intercourse during pregnancy. If cramping,\\nspotting, or bright red bleeding follows coitus, sexual activity should not occur until the patient is\\nevaluated by her clinician. A patient with preterm labor or vaginal bleeding should not have coitus\\nuntil evaluated by her clinician.\\nNutritional Requirements\\nThe mother’s nutrition from the moment of conception is an important factor in the development of\\nthe infant’s metabolic pathways and future well-being. The pregnant woman should be encouraged to\\neat a balanced diet and should be made aware of special needs for iron, folic acid, calcium, and zinc.\\nThe average woman weighing 58 kg (127 lb) has a normal dietary intake of 2300 kcal/d. An additional\\n300 kcal/d is needed during pregnancy, and an additional 500 kcal/d is needed during breastfeeding\\n(\\nTable 6–1\\n).

Roman, MD, MPH\\nLABOR AND DELIVERY\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n Labor is a sequence of uterine contractions that results in effacement and dilatation of the cervix\\nand voluntary bearing-down efforts, leading to the expulsion per vagina of the products of\\nconception.\\n Delivery is the mode of expulsion of the fetus and placenta.\\nPathogenesis\\nLabor and delivery is a normal physiologic process that most women experience without\\ncomplications. The goal of the management of this process is to foster a safe birth for mothers and\\ntheir newborns. Additionally, the staff should attempt to make the patient and her support person(s)\\nfeel welcome, comfortable, and informed throughout the labor and delivery process. Physical contact\\nbetween the newborn and the parents in the delivery room should be encouraged. Every effort should\\nbe made to foster family interaction and to support the desire of the family to be together. The role of\\nthe obstetrician/midwife and the labor and delivery staff is to anticipate and manage complications\\nthat may occur that could harm the mother or the fetus. When a decision is made to intervene, it must\\nbe considered carefully, because each intervention carries both potential benefits and potential risks.\\nThe best management in the majority of cases may be close observation and, when necessary, cautious\\nintervention.\\nPhysiologic Preparation for Labor\\nBefore the onset of true labor, several preparatory physiologic changes commonly occur. The settling\\nof the fetal head into the brim of the pelvis, known as \\nlightening\\n, usually occurs 2 or more weeks\\nbefore labor in first pregnancies. In women who have had a previous delivery, lightening often does\\nnot occur until early labor. Clinically, the mother may notice a flattening of the upper abdomen and\\nincreased pressure in the pelvis. This descent of the fetus is often accompanied by a decrease in\\ndiscomfort associated with crowding of the abdominal organs under the diaphragm (eg, heartburn,\\nshortness of breath) and an increase in pelvic discomfort and frequency of urination.\\nDuring the last 4–8 weeks of pregnancy, irregular, generally painless uterine contractions occur\\nwith slowly increasing frequency. These contractions, known as \\nBraxton Hicks contractions\\n, may\\noccur more frequently, sometimes every 10–20 minutes, and with greater intensity during the last\\nweeks of pregnancy. When these contractions occur early in the third trimester, they must be\\ndistinguished from true preterm labor. Later, they are a common cause of “false labor,” which is'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='distinguished by the lack of cervical change in response to the contractions.\\nDuring the course of several days to several weeks before the onset of true labor, the cervix begins\\nto soften, efface, and dilate. In many cases, when labor starts, the cervix is already dilated 1–3 cm in\\ndiameter. This is usually more pronounced in the multiparous patient, the cervix being relatively more\\nfirm and closed in nulliparous women. With cervical effacement, the mucus plug within the cervical\\ncanal may be released. When this occurs, the onset of labor is sometimes marked by the passage of a\\nsmall amount of blood-tinged mucus from the vagina known as \\nbloody show\\n.\\nMechanism of Labor\\nThe mechanism of labor in the vertex position consists of engagement of the presenting part, flexion,\\ndescent, internal rotation, extension, external rotation, and expulsion (\\nTable 7–1\\n). The progress of\\nlabor is dictated by the pelvic dimensions and configuration, the size of the fetus, and the strength of\\nthe contractions. In essence, delivery proceeds along the line of least resistance, that is, by adaptation\\nof the smallest achievable diameters of the presenting part to the most favorable dimensions and\\ncontours of the birth canal.\\nTable 7–1\\n.

This will vary, of course, if the\\nhead is small in relation to the pelvis or if the pelvis is unusually large. \\nWhen the head is improperly\\nfixed—or if there is significant narrowing of the pelvic strait (as in the platypelloid type of pelvis)—\\nthere may be some degree of deflexion, if not actual extension. Such is the case with a brow\\n(deflexion) or face (extension) presentation.\\nC. Descent\\nDescent is gradually progressive and is affected by the forces of labor and thinning of the lower\\nuterine segment. Other factors also play a part (eg, pelvic configuration and the size and position of\\nthe presenting part). The greater the pelvic resistance or the poorer the contractions, the slower the\\ndescent. Descent continues progressively until the fetus is delivered; the other movements are\\nsuperimposed on it (\\nFig. 7–3\\n).\\nFigure 7–3\\n. Descent in left occipitoanterior position.\\nD. Internal rotation\\nWith the descent of the head into the midpelvis, rotation occurs so that the sagittal suture occupies the\\nanteroposterior diameter of the pelvis. Internal rotation normally begins with the presenting part at the\\nlevel of the ischial spines. The levator ani muscles form a V-shaped sling that tends to rotate the\\nvertex anteriorly. In cases of occipitoanterior vertex, the head has to rotate 45 degrees, and in\\noccipitoposterior vertex, 135 degrees, to pass beneath the pubic arch (\\nFig. 7–4\\n).'),\n",

Extension\\nBecause the vaginal outlet is directed upward and forward, extension must occur before the head can\\npass through it.

Crowning occurs when the largest diameter of the fetal head is encircled by the vulvar ring\\n(\\nFig. 7–5\\n). At this time, spontaneous delivery is imminent.\\nFigure 7–5\\n. Extension of the head.\\nF. External rotation\\nExternal rotation (restitution) follows delivery of the head when it rotates to the position it occupied at\\nengagement. After this, the shoulders descend in a path similar to that traced by the head. The anterior\\nshoulder rotates internally approximately 45 degrees to come under the pubic arch for delivery (\\nFig.\\n7–6\\n).

The duration of the first stage of labor in primipara patients is noted to range from 6–\\n18 hours, whereas in multiparous patients, the range is reported to be 2–10 hours. The lower limit of\\nnormal for the rate of cervical dilatation during the active phase is 1.2 cm per hour in first pregnancies\\nand 1.5 cm per hour in subsequent pregnancies. The duration of the second stage in the primipara is 30\\nminutes to 3 hours and is 5–30 minutes for multiparas. For both, the duration of the third stage was\\nreported to be 0–30 minutes for all pregnancies. These data, although extremely helpful as guidelines,\\nshould not be used as strict deadlines that trigger interventions if not met. Even if a numerical\\n(statistical) approach is used to define “abnormal,” the cutoff figure would not be the average range,\\nbut the 5th percentile numbers (eg, 25.8 hours for the first stage of labor in a primipara). The course\\nthat is more appropriate is to consider the overall clinical presentation and use the progress of labor to\\nestimate the likelihood that successful vaginal delivery will occur.\\nThe first stage of labor is evaluated by the rate of change of cervical effacement, cervical\\ndilatation, and descent of the fetal head.

When a patient is admitted, a\\nhematocrit or hemoglobin measurement should be obtained and a blood clot should be obtained in the\\nevent that a cross-match is needed. A blood group, Rh type, and antibody screen should also be done.\\nThe First Stage of Labor\\nIn the first stage of normal labor, the pregnant woman may be allowed to ambulate or sit in a\\ncomfortable chair as desired. When the patient is lying in bed, the supine position should be\\ndiscouraged. Patients in active labor should avoid ingestion of solid food. Clear liquids, ice chips, or\\npreparations for moistening the mouth and lips should be allowed. When significant amounts of fluids\\nand calories are required because of long labor, they should be given intravenously.\\nMaternal pulse and blood pressure should be recorded at least every 2–4 hours in normal labor and\\nmore frequently \\nif indicated. Maternal fluid balance (ie, urine output and intravenous and oral intake)\\nshould be monitored, and both dehydration and fluid overload should be avoided.\\nManagement of discomfort and pain during labor and delivery is a necessary part of good obstetric\\npractice. A patient’s request is sufficient justification for providing pain relief during labor. Specific\\nanalgesic and anesthetic techniques are discussed in \\nChapter 24\\n. Some patients tolerate the pain of\\nlabor by using techniques learned in childbirth preparation programs. Common methods of\\npreparation include Lamaze, Bradley, Read, hypnotherapy, and prenatal yoga. Although specific\\ntechniques vary, these classes usually teach relief of pain through the application of principles of\\neducation, emotional support, touch, relaxation, paced breathing, and mental focus. The staff at the\\nbedside should be knowledgeable about these pain-management techniques and should be supportive\\nof the patient’s decision to use them. When such methods fail to provide adequate pain relief, some\\npatients will ask for medical assistance, and such requests should be respected. Indeed, the use of\\nappropriate medical analgesic techniques should be explained to the patient and her labor partner and\\ntheir use encouraged when medically indicated.\\nReassurance of fetal well-being is sought through fetal monitoring. Fetal monitoring may be\\nperformed intermittently or continuously, depending on the presence or absence of risk factors for\\nadverse perinatal outcome. In patients with no significant obstetric risk factors, either continuous or\\nintermittent monitoring is acceptable. If the fetus is monitored intermittently, then the fetal heart rate\\nshould be auscultated or the electronic monitor tracing should be evaluated at least every 30 minutes\\nin the active phase of the first stage of labor and at least every 15 minutes in the second stage of labor.\\nIn patients with obstetric risk factors such as hypertension, intrauterine fetal growth restriction,\\ndiabetes, or multiple gestations, continuous fetal monitoring is recommended.\\nUterine contractions may be monitored by palpation, by tocodynamometer, or by internal pressure\\ncatheter. If monitored by palpation, the patient’s abdomen should be palpated every 30 minutes to\\nassess contraction frequency, duration, and intensity. For at-risk pregnancies, uterine contractions\\nshould be monitored continuously along with the fetal heart rate. This can be achieved by using either\\nan external tocodynamometer or an internal pressure catheter in the amniotic cavity.

In the active phase, the cervix should be assessed approximately every 2\\nhours. The cervical effacement and dilatation and the station and position of the fetal head should be\\nrecorded (\\nFig. 7–7\\n). Additional examinations to determine whether full dilation has occurred may be\\nrequired if the patient reports the urge to push, or to search for prolapse of the umbilical cord or\\nperform fetal scalp stimulation if a significant fetal heart rate deceleration is detected.\\nFigure 7–7\\n. Stations of the fetal head. (Reproduced, with permission, from Benson RC. \\nHandbook of\\nObstetrics & Gynecology\\n. 8th ed. Los Altos, CA: Lange; 1983.)\\nThe therapeutic rupture of fetal membranes (amniotomy) has been largely discredited as a means\\nof induction when used alone. Moreover, artificial rupture of the membranes increases the risk of\\nchorioamnionitis and the need for antibiotics (especially if labor is prolonged), as well as the risk of\\ncord prolapse if the presenting part is not engaged. Amniotomy may, however, provide information on\\nthe volume of amniotic fluid and the presence of meconium. In addition, rupture of the membranes\\nmay cause an increase in uterine contractility. Amniotomy should not be performed routinely. It\\nshould be used when internal fetal or uterine monitoring is required and may be helpful when\\nenhancement of uterine contractility in the active phase of labor is indicated. Care should be taken to\\npalpate for the umbilical cord and to avoid dislodging the fetal head. The fetal heart rate should be\\nrecorded before, during, and immediately after the procedure.\\nThe Second Stage of Labor\\nAt the beginning of the second stage of labor, the mother usually feels a desire to bear down with each\\ncontraction. This abdominal pressure, together with the force of the uterine contractions, expels the\\nfetus. During the second stage of labor. the descent of the fetal head is measured to assess the progress\\nof labor. The descent of the fetus is evaluated by measuring the relationship of the bony portion of the\\nfetal head to the level of the maternal ischial spines (station) (\\nFig. 7–7\\n). When the leading portion of\\nthe fetal skull is at the level of the ischial spines, the station is “0.” The American College of\\nObstetricians and Gynecologists–endorsed method for describing station is to estimate the number of\\ncentimeters from the ischial spines. For instance, \\nwhen the leading portion of the head is 2 cm above\\nthe ischial spines, this is reported as −2 station; when the leading portion of the skull is 3 cm below\\nthe ischial spines, this is reported as +3.

These times may vary depending on the pushing efforts of the mother, the quality of the\\nuterine contractions, and the type of analgesia.\\nDelivery\\nWhen the fetal head is noted to crown, delivery is imminent. Careful management by the practitioner\\nwith controlled efforts of the mother will minimize perineal trauma. Routine episiotomy is\\nunnecessary and is associated with increased maternal blood loss, increased risk of disruption of the\\nanal sphincter (third-degree extension) and rectal mucosa (fourth-degree extension), and delay in the\\npatient’s resumption of sexual activity. Further extension follows extrusion of the head beyond the\\nintroitus. Once the head is delivered, the airway is cleared of blood and amniotic fluid using a bulb\\nsuction device. The oral cavity is cleared initially, followed by clearing of the nares.\\nAfter the airway is cleared, an index finger is used to check whether the umbilical cord encircles\\nthe neck. If so, the cord can usually be slipped over the infant’s head.

Delivery of posterior shoulder.\\nAfter delivery, blood will be infused from the placenta into the newborn if the baby is held below\\nthe mother’s introitus. Delayed cord clamping can result in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia as additional\\nblood is transferred to the newborn infant. Generally, a vigorous newborn can be delivered directly\\nfrom the introitus to the abdomen and waiting arms of a healthy, alert mother. Placing the child skin\\nto skin (abdomen to abdomen) results in optimum warmth for the newborn. Then the cord, which has\\nbeen doubly clamped, may be cut between the clamps by either the practitioner, the mother, or her\\npartner.\\nThird Stage of Labor\\nImmediately after the baby is delivered, the cervix and vagina should be inspected for actively\\nbleeding lacerations and surgical repair should be performed as needed. Repair of vaginal lacerations\\nshould be performed using absorbable suture material, either 2-0 or 3-0. The inspection and repair of\\nthe cervix, vagina, and perineum is often easier prior to the separation of the placenta before uterine\\nbleeding obscures visualization.\\nSeparation of the placenta generally occurs within 2–10 minutes of the end of the second stage, but\\nit may take 30 minutes or more to spontaneously separate. Signs of placental separation are as\\nfollows: (1) a fresh show of blood appears from the vagina, (2) the umbilical cord lengthens outside\\nthe vagina, (3) the fundus of the uterus rises up, and (4) the uterus becomes firm and globular. When\\nthese signs appear, it is safe to place traction on the cord. The gentle traction, with or without\\ncounterpressure between the symphysis and fundus to prevent descent of the uterus, allows delivery of\\nthe placenta.\\nAfter the delivery of the placenta, attention is turned to prevention of excessive postpartum\\nbleeding. Uterine contractions that reduce this bleeding may be enhanced with uterine massage and/or\\nthe infusion of a dilute solution of oxytocin. The placenta should be examined to ensure complete\\nremoval and to detect placental abnormalities.\\nPuerperium\\nThe puerperium consists of the period after the delivery of the baby and placenta to approximately 6\\nweeks postpartum. The immediate postpartum period (within the first hour of delivery) is a critical\\ntime for both maternal and neonatal physiologic and emotional adjustment. During that hour, the\\nmaternal blood pressure, pulse rate, and uterine blood loss must be monitored closely. It is during this\\ntime that most postpartum hemorrhage usually occurs, largely as a result of uterine relaxation,\\nretained placental fragments, or unrepaired lacerations. Occult bleeding (eg, vaginal wall hematoma\\nformation) may manifest as increasing pelvic pain.\\nAt the same time, maternal bonding to the newborn is evolving, and ideally breastfeeding is\\ninitiated. Early initiation of breastfeeding is beneficial to the health of both the mother and the\\nnewborn. Both benefit because babies are extremely alert and programmed to latch onto the breast\\nduring this period. Mother–infant pairs that begin breastfeeding early are most able to continue\\nbreastfeeding for longer periods of time. For the mother, nursing accelerates the involution of the\\nuterus, thereby reducing blood loss by increasing uterine contractions. For the newborn, there are\\nimportant immunologic advantages. For example, various maternal antibodies are present in breast\\nmilk, which provide the newborn with passive immunity against certain infections. Also\\nimmunoglobulin (Ig) A, a secretory immunoglobulin present in significant amounts in breast milk,\\nprotects the infant’s gut by preventing attachment of harmful bacteria to cells of the gut mucosal'),\n",

It is also believed that maternal lymphocytes pass through the infant’s gut wall and initiate\\nimmunologic processes that are not yet fully understood. In addition to the immunologic benefits,\\nbreast milk is the ideal nutritional source for the newborn. Moreover, it is inexpensive and is usually\\nin good supply. Given all the advantages (the preceding is only a partial list of the benefits),\\nencouraging successful breastfeeding is an important health goal.\\nInduction and Augmentation of Labor\\nInduction of labor is the process of initiating labor by artificial means; augmentation is the artificial\\nstimulation of labor that has begun spontaneously. Labor induction should be performed only after\\nappropriate assessment of the mother and fetus. Additionally, the risks, benefits, and alternatives to\\ninduction in each case must be evaluated and explained to the patient. In the absence of medical\\nindications for induction, fetal maturity must be confirmed by either exact pregnancy dating, first-\\ntrimester ultrasound measurements, and/or amniotic fluid analysis. Evaluation of the cervical status in\\nterms of effacement and softening is important in predicting success of induction and is highly\\nrecommended before any elective induction (\\nTable 7–2\\n). Generally, induction should be done in\\nresponse to specific indications and should not be done electively prior to 39 weeks gestational age.\\nTable 7–2\\n. Bishop method of pelvic scoring for elective induction of labor.\\nA. Indications\\nThe following are common indications for induction of labor:\\n1. Maternal\\n—Preeclampsia, diabetes mellitus, heart disease.\\n2. Fetal\\n—Prolonged pregnancy, Rh incompatibility, fetal abnormality, chorioamnionitis, premature\\nrupture of membranes, placental insufficiency, suspected intrauterine growth restriction.\\nB. Contraindications\\nAbsolute contraindications to induction of labor include contracted pelvis; placenta previa; uterine\\nscar because of previous classical caesarean section, myomectomy entering the endometrium,\\nhysterotomy, or unification surgery; and transverse lie.\\nLabor induction should be carried out with caution in the following situations: breech presentation,\\noligohydramnios, multiple gestation, grand multiparity, previous caesarean section with transverse'),\n",

For the mother\\nIn many cases, induction of labor exposes the mother to more distress and discomfort than judicious\\ndelay and subsequent vaginal or caesarean delivery. The following hazards must be kept in mind: (1)\\nfailure of induction with increased risk of caesarean delivery; (2) uterine inertia and prolonged labor;\\n(3) tumultuous labor and tetanic contractions of the uterus, causing premature separation of the\\nplacenta, rupture of the uterus, and laceration of the cervix; (4) intrauterine infection; and (5)\\npostpartum hemorrhage.\\nB. For the fetus\\nAn induced delivery exposes the infant to the risk of prematurity if the estimated date of conception\\nhas been inaccurately calculated. Precipitous delivery may result in physical injury. Prolapse of the\\ncord may follow amniotomy. Injudicious administration of oxytocin or inadequate observation during\\ninduction could lead to fetal heart rate abnormalities or delivery of a baby with poor Apgar scores.\\nMethods of Cervical Ripening\\nCervical ripening before induction of labor could facilitate the onset and progression of labor and\\nincrease the chance of vaginal delivery, particularly in primigravid patients.\\nA. Prostaglandin\\nTwo forms of prostaglandins are commonly used for cervical ripening before induction at term:\\nmisoprostol (PGE\\n1\\n) and dinoprostone (PGE\\n2\\n). Although only dinoprostone, commercially available as\\nprostaglandin gel, is currently Food and Drug Administration–approved for this use, off-label use of\\nmisoprostol for cervical ripening is widely practiced. Indeed, although both misoprostol and\\ndinoprostone applied locally intravaginally can provide significant improvement in the Bishop score,\\na meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials focusing on cervical ripening and induction of labor\\nfound the time to delivery was shorter and the rate of caesarean delivery was lower in the misoprostol\\ngroup.\\nDinoprostone comes prepackaged in a single-dose syringe containing 0.5 mg of PGE\\n2\\n in 2.5 mL of\\na viscous gel of colloidal silicon dioxide in triacetin. The syringe is attached to a soft-plastic catheter\\nfor intracervical administration, and the catheter is shielded to help prevent application above the\\ninternal cervical os. Misoprostol is manufactured in 100-μg unscored and 200-μg scored tablets that\\ncan be administered orally, vaginally, and rectally. PGE\\n2\\n should not be used in patients with a history\\nof asthma, glaucoma, or myocardial infarction. Unexplained vaginal bleeding, chorioamnionitis,\\nruptured membranes, and previous caesarean section are relative contraindications to the use of\\nprostaglandins for cervical ripening.\\nFor cervical ripening and induction at term, misoprostol is given vaginally at a dose of 25 μg every\\n4–6 hours. With dinoprostone, usually 12 hours should be allowed for cervical ripening, after which\\noxytocin induction should be started. PGE\\n1\\n and PGE\\n2\\n have similar side-effect and risk profiles,\\nincluding fetal heart rate deceleration, fetal distress, emergency caesarean section, uterine\\nhypertonicity, nausea, vomiting, fever, and peripartum infection. However, a current literature review\\ndoes not indicate any significant differences in reported side effects between control and treatment'),\n",

Balloon catheter\\nA Foley catheter with a 25- to 50-mL balloon is passed into the endocervix above the internal os using\\ntissue forceps. The balloon is then inflated with sterile saline, and the catheter is withdrawn gently to\\nthe level of internal cervical os. This method should induce cervical ripening over 8–12 hours. The\\ncervix will be dilated 2–3 cm when the balloon falls out, which will make amniotomy possible, but\\neffacement may be unchanged.\\nC. Hygroscopic dilators\\nLaminaria tents are made from desiccated stems of the cold-water seaweed \\nLaminaria digitata\\n or \\nL\\njaponica\\n. When placed in the endocervix for 6–12 hours, the laminaria increases in diameter 3- to 4-\\nfold by extracting water from cervical tissues, gradually swelling and expanding the cervical canal.\\nSynthetic dilators like lamicel, a polyvinyl alcohol polymer sponge impregnated with 450 mg of\\nmagnesium sulfate, and dilapan, which is made from a stable nontoxic hydrophilic polymer of\\npolyacrylonitrile, are also noted to be highly effective in mechanical cervical dilation.\\nMethods of Induction of Labor\\nA. Oxytocin\\nIntravenous administration of a very dilute solution of oxytocin is the most effective medical means\\nof inducing labor. Oxytocin exaggerates the inherent rhythmic pattern of uterine motility, which often\\nbecomes clinically evident during the last trimester and increases as term is approached.\\nThe dosage must be individualized. The administration of oxytocin is determined with a biologic\\nassay: The smallest possible effective dose must be determined for each patient and then used to\\ninitiate and maintain labor. Constant observation by qualified attendants is required when this method\\nis used.\\nIn most cases it is sufficient to add 1 mL of oxytocin (10 units of oxytocin to 1 L of 5% dextrose in\\nwater [1 mU/mL]). One acceptable oxytocin infusion regimen is to begin induction or augmentation at\\n1 mU/min, preferably \\nwith an infusion pump or other accurate delivery system, and increase oxytocin\\nin 2-mU increments at 15-minute intervals.\\nWhen contractions of 50–60 mm Hg (per the internal monitor pressure) or lasting 40–60 seconds\\n(per the external monitor) occur at 2.5- to 4-minute intervals, the oxytocin dose should be increased\\nno further. Oxytocin infusion is discontinued whenever hyperstimulation or fetal distress is identified,\\nbut can be restarted when reassuring fetal heart rate and uterine activity patterns are restored.\\nB. Amniotomy\\nEarly and variable decelerations of the fetal heart rate are noted to be relatively common with\\namniotomy. Nonetheless, amniotomy may be an effective way to induce labor in carefully selected\\ncases with high Bishop scores. Release of amniotic fluid shortens the muscle bundles of the\\nmyometrium; the strength and duration of the contractions are thereby increased, and a more rapid\\ncontraction sequence follows. The membranes should be ruptured with an amniohook. Make no effort\\nto strip the membranes, and do not displace the head upward to drain off amniotic fluid. Because\\namniotomy has not been proven effective in augmenting labor uniformly, it is recommended that the\\nactive phase of labor be entered before performing amniotomy for augmentation. Amniotomy in\\nselected cases, although slightly increasing the risk of infectious morbidity, could shorten the course'),\n",

GFR reaches a peak increment of 40–65%\\nby the end of the first trimester and remains high until term (\\nFig. 8–4\\n). The fraction of renal plasma\\nflow that passes through the glomerular membrane (filtration fraction) decreases during the first 20\\nweeks of gestation, which subsequently rises toward term.\\nFigure 8–4\\n.

Creatinine production (0.7–1.0 g/day) by\\nskeletal muscle is virtually unchanged by pregnancy.\\nUp to 80% of the glomerular filtrate is reabsorbed by the proximal tubules, a process that is\\nindependent of hormonal control. Aldosterone regulates sodium reabsorption in the distal tubules,\\nwhereas arginine vasopressin activity, which regulates free water clearance, determines the ultimate\\nurine concentration. Pregnancy is associated with increased circulating concentrations of aldosterone.\\nEven though the GFR increases dramatically during gestation, the volume of urine excreted per day is\\nunchanged.\\nRenal clearance of creatinine increases as the GFR rises, with maximum clearances approximately\\n50% more than nonpregnant levels. The creatinine clearance decreases somewhat after approximately\\n30 weeks of gestation. The rise in GFR lowers mean serum creatinine concentrations (pregnant, \\n; nonpregnant, \\n) and blood urea nitrogen (pregnant, \\n; nonpregnant, \\n mg/100 mL) concentrations.\\nIncreased GFR with saturation of tubular resorption capacity for filtered glucose can result in\\nglucosuria.

This enzyme is\\ncritically involved in the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I, which subsequently forms\\nthe potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. Angiotensin II levels also increase in pregnancy, but the\\nvasoconstriction and hypertension that might be expected do not occur. In fact, normal pregnant\\nwomen are very resistant to the pressor effects of elevated levels of angiotensin II and other\\nvasopressors; this effect is likely mediated by increased vascular synthesis of nitric oxide and other\\nvasodilators.\\nAngiotensin II is also a potent stimulus for adrenocortical secretion of aldosterone, which, in\\nconjunction with arginine vasopressin, promotes salt and water retention in pregnancy. The net effect\\nis a decrease in plasma sodium concentrations by approximately 5 mEq/L and a fall in plasma\\nosmolality by nearly 10 mOsm/kg. These effects on electrolyte homeostasis likely involve a resetting\\nof the pituitary osmostat. In pregnancy, the increased pituitary secretion of vasopressin is largely\\nbalanced by placental production of vasopressinase.

Pregnant women tend to rest more often, which conserves energy and thereby enhances fetal\\nnutrition. The maternal appetite and food intake usually increase, although some have a decreased\\nappetite or experience nausea and vomiting (see \\nChapter 6\\n). In rare instances, women with pica may\\ncrave substances such as clay, cornstarch, soap, or even coal.\\nPregnancy is associated with profound changes in structure and metabolism. The most obvious\\nphysical changes are weight gain and altered body shape. Weight gain results not only from the uterus\\nand its contents, but also from increased breast tissue, blood volume, and water volume\\n(approximately 6.8 L) in the form of extravascular and extracellular fluid. Deposition of fat and\\nprotein and increased cellular water are added to maternal stores. The average weight gain during\\npregnancy is 12.5 kg (27.5 lb).\\nProtein accretion accounts for approximately 1 kg of maternal weight gain, which is evenly divided\\nbetween the mother (uterine contractile protein, breast glandular tissue, plasma protein, and\\nhemoglobin) and the fetoplacental unit.\\nTotal body fat increases during pregnancy, but the amount varies with the total weight gain. During\\nthe second half of pregnancy, plasma lipids increase (plasma cholesterol \\nincreases 50%, plasma\\ntriglyceride concentration may triple), but triglycerides, cholesterol, and lipoproteins decrease soon\\nafter delivery. The ratio of low-density lipoproteins to high-density lipoproteins increases during\\npregnancy.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='In the evolution of viviparous species, the yolk sac presumably is the most archaic type of\\nplacentation, having developed from the egg-laying ancestors of mammals. In higher mammals, the\\nallantoic sac\\n fuses with the chorion, forming the chorioallantoic placenta, which has mesodermal\\nvascular villi. When the trophoblast actually invades the maternal endometrium (which in pregnancy\\nis largely composed of decidua), a deciduate placenta results. In humans, maternal blood comes into\\ndirect contact with the fetal trophoblast.\\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE PLACENTA\\nSoon after ovulation, the endometrium develops its typical secretory pattern under the influence of\\nprogesterone from the corpus luteum. The peak of development occurs at approximately 1 week after\\novulation, coinciding with the expected time for implantation of a fertilized ovum.\\nThe first cleavage occurs during the next 36 hours after the cellular union of the egg and sperm. As\\nthe conceptus continues to divide and grow, the peristaltic activity of the uterine tube slowly\\ntransports it to the uterus, a journey that requires 6–7 days. Concomitantly, a series of divisions\\ncreates a hollow ball, the \\nblastocyst\\n, which then implants within the endometrium. Most cells in the\\nwall of the blastocyst are trophoblastic; only a few are destined to become the embryo.\\nWithin a few hours after implantation, the trophoblast invades the endometrium and begins to\\nproduce \\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG\\n), which is thought to be important in converting the\\nnormal corpus luteum into the corpus luteum of pregnancy. As the cytotrophoblasts (\\nLanghans’ cells\\n)\\ndivide and proliferate, they form transitional cells that are the likely source of hCG. Next, these\\ntransitional cells fuse, lose their individual membranes, and form the multinucleated\\nsyncytiotrophoblast\\n. Mitotic division then ceases. Thus the syncytial layer becomes the front line of\\nthe invading fetal tissue. Maternal capillaries and venules are tapped by the invading fetal tissue to\\ncause extravasation of maternal blood and the formation of small lakes (lacunae), the forerunners of\\nthe intervillous space. These lacunae fill with maternal blood by reflux from previously tapped veins.\\nAn occasional maternal artery then opens, and a sluggish circulation is established (hemato-tropic\\nphase of the embryo).\\nThe lacunar system is separated by trabeculae, many of which develop buds or extensions. Within\\nthese branching projections, the cytotrophoblast forms a mesenchymal core.\\nThe proliferating trophoblast cells then branch to form secondary and tertiary villi. The \\nmesoblast\\n,\\nor central stromal core, also formed from the original trophoblast, invades these columns to form a\\nsupportive structure within which capillaries are formed. The \\nembryonic body stalk\\n (later to become\\nthe umbilical cord) invades this stromal core to establish the fetoplacental circulation. If this last step\\ndoes not occur, the embryo will die. Sensitive tests for hCG suggest that at this stage, more embryos\\ndie than live.\\nWhere the placenta is attached, the branching villi resemble a leafy tree (the \\nchorion frondosum\\n),\\nwhereas the portion of the placenta covering the expanding conceptus is smoother (\\nchorion laeve\\n).\\nWhen the latter is finally pushed against the opposite wall of the uterus, the villi atrophy, leaving the\\namnion and chorion to form the 2-layered sac of fetal membranes.\\nAt approximately 40 days after conception, the trophoblast has invaded approximately 40–60 spiral\\narterioles, of which 12–15 may be called major arteries.

The human placenta has no peripheral venous collecting system. Within\\neach maternal vascular unit is the fetal vascular “tree,” with the tertiary free-floating villi (the major\\narea for physiologic exchange) acting as thousands of baffles that disperse the maternal bloodstream\\nin many directions.\\nFUNCTIONS OF THE MATERNAL– PLACENTAL–FETAL UNIT\\nThe placenta is a complex organ of internal secretion, releasing numerous hormones and enzymes into\\nthe maternal bloodstream. In addition, it serves as the organ of transport for all fetal nutrients and\\nmetabolic products as well as for the exchange of oxygen and CO\\n2\\n. Although fetal in origin, the\\nplacenta depends almost entirely on maternal blood for its nourishment.\\nThe arterial pressure of maternal blood (60–70 mm Hg) causes it to pulsate toward the chorionic\\nplate into the low-pressure (20 mm Hg) intervillous space. Venous blood in the placenta tends to flow\\nalong the basal plate and out through the venules directly into maternal veins. The pressure gradient\\nwithin the fetal circulation changes slowly with the mother’s posture, fetal movements, and physical\\nstress. The pressure within the placental intervillous space is approximately 10 mm Hg when the\\npregnant woman is lying down. After a few minutes of standing, this pressure exceeds 30 mm Hg. In\\ncomparison, the fetal capillary pressure is 20–40 mm Hg.\\nClinically, placental perfusion can be altered by many physiologic changes in the mother or fetus.\\nWhen a precipitous fall in maternal blood pressure occurs, increased plasma volume improves\\nplacental perfusion. Increasing the maternal volume with saline infusion increases the fetal oxygen\\nsaturation. An increased rate of rhythmic uterine contractions benefits placental perfusion, but tetanic\\nlabor contractions are detrimental to placental and fetal circulation as they do not allow a resting\\nperiod in which normal flow resumes to the fetus. An increased fetal heart rate tends to expand the\\nvilli during systole, but this is a minor aid in circulatory transfer.\\nCirculatory Function\\nA. Uteroplacental Circulation\\nThe magnitude of the uteroplacental circulation is difficult to measure in humans. The consensus is\\nthat total uterine blood flow near term is 500–700 mL/min. Not all of this blood traverses the\\nintervillous space. It is generally assumed that approximately 85% of the uterine blood flow goes to\\nthe cotyledons and the rest to the myometrium and endometrium. One may assume that blood flow in\\nthe placenta is 400–500 mL/min in a patient near term who is lying quietly on her side and is not in\\nlabor.\\nAs the placenta matures, thrombosis decreases the number of arterial openings into the basal plate.\\nAt term, the ratio of veins to arteries is 2:1 (approximately the ratio found in other mature organs).\\nNear their entry into the intervillous spaces, the terminal maternal arterioles lose their elastic\\nreticulum. Because the distal portions of these vessels are lost with the placenta, bleeding from their\\nsource can be controlled only by uterine contraction. Thus uterine atony causes postpartum\\nhemorrhage.\\nB.

As a consequence of the action of cytotrophoblast on the spiral artery vessel wall, the\\nnormal musculoelastic tissue is replaced by a mixture of fibrinoid and fibrous tissue. The small spiral\\narteries are converted to large tortuous channels, creating low-resistance channels or arteriovenous\\nshunts.\\nIn early normal pregnancy, there is an early increase in plasma volume and resulting physiologic\\nanemia as the red blood cell mass slowly expands. Immediately after delivery, with closure of the\\nplacental shunt, diuresis and natriuresis occur. When the spiral arteries fail to undergo these\\nphysiologic changes, fetal growth retardation often occurs with preeclampsia. “Evaluating uterine\\narteries, which serve the spiral arteries and the placenta in the pregnant women, offers an indirect\\nmethod of monitoring the spiral arteries.” Fleischer and colleagues (1986) reported that normal\\npregnancy is associated with a uterine artery Doppler velocimetry systolic/diastolic ratio of less than\\n2:6. With a higher ratio and a notch in the waveform, the pregnancy is usually complicated by\\nstillbirth, premature birth, intrauterine growth retardation, or preeclampsia.\\nC. Fetoplacental Circulation\\nAt term, a normal fetus has a total umbilical blood flow of 350–400 mL/min. Thus the\\nmaternoplacental and fetoplacental flows have a similar order of magnitude.\\nThe villous system is best compared with an inverted tree. The branches pass obliquely downward\\nand outward within the intervillous spaces. This arrangement probably permits preferential currents or\\ngradients of flow and undoubtedly encourages intervillous fibrin deposition, commonly seen in the\\nmature placenta.\\nCotyledons\\n (subdivisions of the placenta) can be identified early in placentation. Although they are\\nseparated by the placental septa, some communication occurs via the subchorionic lake in the roof of\\nthe intervillous spaces.\\nBefore labor, placental filling occurs whenever the uterus contracts (\\nBraxton Hicks contractions\\n).\\nAt these times, the \\nmaternal venous exits are closed, but the thicker-walled arteries are only slightly\\nnarrowed. When the uterus relaxes, blood drains out through the maternal veins. Hence blood is not\\nsqueezed out of the placental lake with each contraction, nor does it enter the placental lake in\\nappreciably greater amounts during relaxation.\\nDuring the height of an average first-stage contraction, most of the cotyledons are devoid of any\\nflow and the remainder are only partially filled. Thus, intermittently—for periods of up to a minute—\\nmaternoplacental flow virtually ceases. Therefore, it should be evident that any extended prolongation\\nof the contractile phase, as in uterine tetany, could lead to fetal hypoxia.\\nEndocrine Function\\nA. Secretions of the Maternal– Placental–Fetal Unit\\nThe placenta and the maternal–placental–fetal unit produce increasing amounts of steroids late in the\\nfirst trimester. Of greatest importance are the steroids required in fetal development from 7 weeks’\\ngestation through parturition. Immediately after conception and until 12–13 weeks’ gestation, the\\nprincipal source of circulating gestational steroids (progesterone is the major one) is the corpus\\nluteum of pregnancy.\\nAfter 42 days, the placenta assumes an increasingly important role in the production of several\\nsteroid hormones.

Recent evidence suggests that hCG is produced by the\\nsyncytiotrophoblast of the placenta. hCG is elaborated by all types of trophoblastic tissue, including\\nthat of hydatidiform moles, chorioadenoma destruens, and choriocarcinoma. As with all glycoprotein\\nhormones (LH, follicle-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), hCG is composed\\nof 2 subunits, α and β.

Concentrations of hCG rise\\nexponentially until 9–10 weeks’ gestation, with a doubling time of 1.3–2 days.\\nConcentrations peak at 60–90 days’ gestation. Afterward, hCG levels decrease to a plateau that is\\nmaintained until delivery. The half-life of hCG is approximately 32–37 hours, in contrast to that of\\nmost protein and steroid hormones, which have half-lives measured in minutes. Structural\\ncharacteristics of the hCG molecule allow it to interact with the human TSH receptor in activation of\\nthe membrane adenylate cyclase that regulates thyroid cell function.

Human chorionic somatomammotropin\\n—Human chorionic somatomammotropin (hCS),\\npreviously referred to as designated \\nhuman placental lactogen\\n, is a protein hormone with\\nimmunologic and biologic similarities to the pituitary growth hormone. It is synthesized in the\\nsyncytiotrophoblastic layer of the placenta. It can be found \\nin maternal serum and urine in both\\nnormal and molar pregnancies. However, it disappears so rapidly from serum and urine after delivery\\nof the placenta or evacuation of the uterus that it cannot be detected in the serum after the first\\npostpartum day. The somatotropic activity of hCS is 3%, which is less than that of human growth\\nhormone (hGH). In vitro, hCS stimulates thymidine incorporation into DNA and enhances the action\\nof hGH and insulin. It is present in microgram-per-milliliter quantities in early pregnancy, but its\\nconcentration increases as pregnancy progresses, with peak levels reached during the last 4 weeks.\\nProlonged fasting at midgestation and insulin-induced hypoglycemia are reported to raise hCS\\nconcentrations. hCS may exert its major metabolic effect on the mother to ensure that the nutritional\\ndemands of the fetus are met.\\nIt has been suggested that hCS is the “growth hormone” of pregnancy. The in vivo effects of hCS\\nowing to its growth hormonelike and anti-insulin characteristics result in impaired glucose uptake and\\nstimulation of free fatty acid release, with resultant decrease in insulin effect.\\n3. Placental proteins\\n—A number of proteins thought to be specific to the pregnant state have been\\nisolated. The most commonly known are the 4 pregnancy-associated plasma proteins (PAPPs)\\ndesignated as PAPP-A, PAPP-B, PAPP-C, and PAPP-D. PAPP-D is the hormone hCS (described\\nearlier). All these proteins are produced by the placenta and/or decidua. The physiologic role of these\\nproteins, except for PAPP-D, are at present unclear. Numerous investigators have postulated various\\nfunctions, ranging from facilitating fetal “allograft” survival and the regulation of coagulation and\\ncomplement cascades to the maintenance of the placenta and the regulation of carbohydrate\\nmetabolism in pregnancy. In vitro studies of PAPP-A in knockout mouse models show it functioning\\nas a regulator of local insulin-like growth factor bioavailability.\\nC. Fetoplacental Secretions\\nThe placenta may be an incomplete steroid-producing organ that must rely on precursors reaching it\\nfrom the fetal and maternal circulations (an integrated-maternal–placental–fetal unit). The adult\\nsteroid-producing glands can form progestins, androgens, and estrogens, but this is not true of the\\nplacenta. Estrogen production by the placenta is dependent on precursors reaching it from both the\\nfetal and maternal compartments. Placental progesterone formation is accomplished in large part from\\ncirculating maternal cholesterol.\\nIn the placenta, cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and then rapidly and efficiently to\\nprogesterone. Production of progesterone approximates 250 mg per day by the end of pregnancy, at\\nwhich time circulating levels are on the order of 130 mg/mL. To form estrogens, the placenta, which\\nhas an active aromatizing capacity, uses circulating androgens obtained primarily from the fetus but\\nalso from the mother. \\nThe major androgenic precursor is \\ndehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS\\n).\\nThis compound comes from the fetal adrenal gland. Because the placenta has an abundance of\\nsulfatase (sulfate-cleaving) enzyme, DHEAS is converted to free unconjugated DHEA when it reaches\\nthe placenta, then to androstenedione, testosterone, and finally estrone and 17β-estradiol.\\nThe major estrogen formed in pregnancy is estriol; however, its functional value is not well\\nunderstood. It appears to be effective in increasing uteroplacental blood flow, as it has a relatively\\nweak estrogenic effect on other organ systems. Ninety percent of the estrogen in the urine of pregnant'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='women is estriol.\\nCirculating progesterone and estriol are thought to be important during pregnancy because they are\\npresent in such large amounts. Progesterone may play a role in maintaining the myometrium in a state\\nof relative quiescence during much of pregnancy. A high local (intrauterine) concentration of\\nprogesterone may block cellular immune responses to foreign antigens. Progesterone appears to be\\nessential for maintaining pregnancy in almost all mammals examined. This suggests that progesterone\\nmay be instrumental in conferring immunologic privilege to the uterus.\\nPlacental Transport\\nThe placenta has a high rate of metabolism, with consumption of oxygen and glucose occurring at a\\nfaster rate than in the fetus. Presumably, this high metabolism requirement is caused by multiple\\ntransport and biosynthesis activities.\\nThe primary function of the placenta is the transport of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus and the\\nreverse transfer of CO\\n2\\n, urea, and other catabolites back to the mother. In general, those compounds\\nthat are essential for the minute-by-minute homeostasis of the fetus (eg, oxygen, CO\\n2\\n, water, sodium)\\nare transported very rapidly by diffusion. Compounds required for the synthesis of new tissues (eg,\\namino acids, enzyme cofactors such as vitamins) are transported by an active process. Substances such\\nas certain maternal hormones, which may modify fetal growth and are at the upper limits of\\nadmissible molecular size, may diffuse very slowly, whereas proteins such as IgG immunoglobulins\\nprobably reach the fetus by the process of pinocytosis. This transfer takes place by at least 5\\nmechanisms: simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport, pinocytosis, and leakage.\\nA. Mechanisms of Transport\\n1. Simple diffusion\\n—Simple diffusion is the method by which gases and other simple molecules\\ncross the placenta. The rate of transport depends on the chemical gradient, the diffusion constant of\\nthe compound in question, and the total area of the placenta available for transfer (Fick’s law). The\\nchemical gradient (ie, the differences in concentration in fetal and maternal plasma) is in turn affected\\nby the rates of flow of uteroplacental and umbilical blood. Simple diffusion is also the method of\\ntransfer for exogenous compounds such as drugs.\\n2. Facilitated diffusion\\n—The prime example of a substance transported by facilitated diffusion is\\nglucose, the major source of energy for the fetus. Presumably, a carrier system operates \\nwith\\n the\\nchemical gradient (as opposed to active transport, which operates \\nagainst\\n the gradient) and may\\nbecome saturated at high glucose concentrations. In the steady state, the glucose concentration in fetal\\nplasma is approximately two-thirds that of the maternal concentration, reflecting the rapid rate of fetal\\nutilization. Substances of low molecular weight, minimal electric charge, and high lipid solubility\\ndiffuse across the placenta with ease.\\n3. Active transport\\n—Selective transport of specific essential nutrients and amnio acids are\\naccomplished by enzymatic mechanisms.\\n4. Pinocytosis\\n—Electron microscopy has shown pseudo-podial projections of the\\nsyncytiotrophoblastic layer that reach out to surround minute amounts of maternal plasma. These\\nparticles are carried across the cell virtually intact to be released on the other side, whereupon they\\npromptly gain access to the fetal circulation. Certain other proteins (eg, foreign antigens) may be\\nimmunologically rejected. This process may work both to and from the fetus, but the selectivity of the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='process has not been determined. Complex proteins, small amounts of fat, some immunoglobulins,\\nand even viruses may traverse the placenta in this way. For the passage of complex proteins, highly\\nselective processes involving special receptors are involved. For example, maternal antibodies of the\\nIgG class are freely transferred, whereas other antibodies are not.\\n5. Leakage\\n—Gross breaks in the placental membrane may occur, allowing the passage of intact cells.\\nDespite the fact that the hydrostatic pressure gradient is normally from fetus to mother, tagged red\\ncells and white cells have been found to travel in either direction. Such breaks probably occur most\\noften during labor or with placental disruption (abruptio placentae, placenta previa, or trauma),\\ncaesarean section, or intrauterine fetal death. It is at these times that fetal red cells can most often be\\ndemonstrated in the maternal circulation. This is the mechanism by which the mother may become\\nsensitized to fetal red cell antigens such as the D (Rh) antigen.\\nB. Placental Transport of Drugs\\nThe placental membranes are often referred to as a “barrier” to fetal transfer, but there are few\\nsubstances (eg, drugs) that will not cross the membranes at all. A few compounds, such as heparin and\\ninsulin, are of sufficiently large molecular size or charge that minimal transfer occurs. This lack of\\ntransfer is almost unique among drugs. Most medications are transferred \\nfrom the maternal to the\\nfetal circulation by simple diffusion, the rate of which is determined by the respective gradients of the\\ndrugs.\\nThese diffusion gradients are influenced in turn by a number of serum factors, including the degree\\nof drug-protein binding (eg, sex hormone binding globulin). Because serum albumin concentration is\\nconsiderably lower during pregnancy, drugs that bind almost exclusively to plasma albumin (eg,\\nwarfarin, salicylates) may have relatively higher unbound concentrations and, therefore, an effectively\\nhigher placental gradient. By contrast, a compound such as carbon monoxide may attach itself so\\nstrongly to the increased total hemoglobin that there will be little left in the plasma for transport.\\nThe placenta also acts as a lipoidal resistance factor to the transfer of water-soluble foreign organic\\nchemicals; as a result, chemicals and drugs that are readily soluble in lipids are transferred much more\\neasily across the placental barrier than are water-soluble drugs or molecules. Ionized drug molecules\\nare highly water soluble and are therefore poorly transmitted across the placenta. Because ionization\\nof chemicals depends in part on their pH-pK relationships, multiple factors determine this “simple\\ndiffusion” of drugs across the placenta. Obviously, drug transfer is not simple, and one must assume\\nthat some amount of almost any drug will cross the placenta.\\nANATOMIC DISORDERS OF THE PLACENTA\\nObservation of structural alterations within the placenta may indicate fetal and maternal disease that\\notherwise might go undetected.\\nTwin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome\\nNearly all monochorionic twin placentas show an anastomosis between the vessels of the 2 umbilical\\ncirculations, but differ in number, direction, and size of the anastomoses. These usually involve the\\nmajor branches of the arteries and veins in the placental surface. Artery-to-artery communications are\\nfound in 75% of the monochorionic twin placentas. Less frequently found are vein-to-vein and artery-\\nto-vein anastomoses. Of great pathologic significance are deep arteriovenous communications\\nbetween the 2 circulations. This occurs when there are shared lobules supplied by an umbilical arterial\\nbranch from one fetus and drained by an umbilical vein branch of the other fetus. This is found in'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='approximately half of all monochorionic twin placentas. Fortunately, one-way flow to the shared\\nlobule may be compensated for by reverse flow through a superficial arterioarterial or venovenous\\nanastomosis, if they coexist.\\nTwin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTS) arises when shared lobules causing blood flow from one\\ntwin to the other are not compensated for by the presence of superficial anastomosis or by shared\\nlobules, causing flow in the opposite direction. This syndrome occurs in 15–20% of cases of\\nmonochorial placentation The twin receiving the transfusion is plethoric and polycythemic and may\\nshow cardiomegaly. The donor twin is pale and anemic and may have organ weights similar to those\\nseen in the intrauterine malnutrition form of small for gestational age.\\nPlacental Infarction\\nA placental infarct is an area of ischemic necrosis of placental villi resulting from obstruction of\\nblood flow through the spiral arteries as a result of thrombosis. The lesions have a lobular distribution.\\nHowever, the spiral arteries are not true end arteries, and if there is adequate flow through the arteries\\nsupplying adjacent lobules, sufficient circulation will be maintained to prevent necrosis. Thus\\nischemic necrosis of one placental lobule probably indicates not only that the spiral artery supplying\\nthe infarcted lobule is thrombosed, but that flow through adjacent spiral arteries is severely impaired.\\nPlacental infarction may serve as a mechanism allowing the fetus to redistribute blood flow to those\\nplacental lobules that are adequately supplied by the maternal circulation. Although often seen in\\nmature placentas at low levels, the infarct must be extensive before the fetus is physiologically\\nimpaired.\\nChorioangioma of the Placenta\\nA benign neoplasm occurring in approximately 1% of placentas and composed of fetoplacental\\ncapillaries may occur within the placenta. It is grossly visible as a purplered, apparently encapsulated\\nmass, variable in size, and occasionally multicentered. Placental hemangiomas, or “chorioangiomas,”\\nthat measure 5 cm or more may be linked with maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications due to\\narteriovenous shunting of blood away from the fetus. Many placental tumors are accompanied by\\nhydramnios, hemorrhage, preterm delivery, and fetal growth restriction.\\nAmniotic Bands\\nClose inspection of the fetal membranes, particularly near the umbilical cord insertion, may reveal\\nband or stringlike membrane segments that are easily lifted above the placental surface. The origin of\\namniotic bands is unclear. Proposed mechanism include tearing in the amnion early in pregnancy as\\nwell as inherited developmental abnormality. They may cause constriction of the developing limbs or\\nother digits. Amputation has been known to result. Syndactyly, clubfoot, and fusion deformities of the\\ncranium and face may also be explained in certain instances on the basis of amniotic bands.\\nPlacental Pathology\\nAny infant born with a complication may benefit from histologic evaluation of the placenta and\\numbilical cord. \\nHistopathologic features of a placenta with uteroplacental insufficiency include\\nnonmarginal infarcts, shrunken placental villi, increased syncytial knots, increased perivillous fibrin,\\nand multifocal and diffuse fibrin deposition. Similarly, if the ratio of nucleated red blood cells to\\nleukocytes exceeds 2:3, this indicates fetal hypoxic stress. Chorangiosis is a pathologic change that\\nindicates long-standing placental hypoperfusion or low-grade tissue hypoxia.'),\n",

Stained vernix\\nequates with exposure of meconium for 15 hours or longer.\\nMicroscopic evaluation also sheds light on the timing of the release of meconium. Meconium-\\nladen macrophages at the chorionic surface of the placenta can be seen when meconium has been\\npresent for 2–3 hours. When these macrophages are found deep within the extraplacental membranes,\\nmeconium has been present for at least 6–12 hours.\\nLastly, when evaluation of the umbilical cord demonstrates necrobiotic and necrotic arterial media\\nwith surrounding meconium-laden macrophages, the release of meconium occurred more than 48\\nhours before delivery.\\nAbnormalities of Placental Implantation\\nNormally the placenta selects a location on the endometrium that benefits the growing fetus. However,\\nthere are numerous instances when the placental implantation site is not beneficial.\\nPlacenta previa\\n, or the implantation of the placenta over the cervical os, is the most common. The\\nincidence at 12 weeks’ gestation is approximately 6% because of the advancement of transvaginal\\nimaging. Fortunately, most cases of placenta previa resolve by the time of delivery (reported\\nincidence of 5/1000 births). A marginal placenta previa occurs when the edge of the placenta lies\\nwithin 2–3 cm of the cervical os; the prevalence ranges from 10–45% when the less accurate\\nabdominal ultra-sonogram is used.\\nAssociated consequences of these abnormal placentation sites include increased risk for bleeding,\\nboth for the mother and the fetus, increased need for caesarean delivery, and possible risk of placenta\\naccreta and increta or percreta, abruption, and growth restriction. Once the placental edge moves\\nbeyond 2–3 cm from the cervical os, these risks are minimized.\\nPlacenta accreta\\n is the most dangerous consequence of placenta previa. It involves abnormal\\ntrophoblastic invasion beyond the Nitabuch’s layer. Placenta increta is the term used to describe\\ninvasion into the myometrium. Placenta percreta describes invasion through the serosa with possible\\ninvasion into surrounding tissues such as the bladder. Placenta accreta is associated with life-\\nthreatening postpartum hemorrhage and increased need for immediate hysterectomy.\\nThe risk factors for placenta previa and placenta accreta are similar. Advanced maternal age,\\nincreased parity, and prior uterine surgery are common risk factors for both entities. The strongest\\ncorrelation appears to exist with prior uterine surgeries. The prevalence of placenta previa after 1 prior\\ncaesarean delivery reaches 0.65% versus 0.26% in the unscarred uterus. However, after 4 or more\\ncaesarean deliveries the prevalence reaches 10%. Similarly, the frequency of accreta in the presence\\nof placenta previa increases as the number of uterine surgeries increases. In patients with 1 prior\\nuterine surgery, accreta occurs in 24% of placenta previas, whereas after 4 or more surgeries, the\\nfrequency of placenta accreta may be as high as 67%.\\nPlacenta accreta may be suspected with certain ultrasound findings such as loss of the hypoechoic\\nretroplacental myometrial zone, thinning or disruption of the hyperechoic uterine serosa-bladder\\ninterface, or with visualization of an exophytic mass. In all cases of placenta previa, and especially if\\nplacenta accreta is suspected, the patient must be counseled that hysterectomy may be needed to\\ncontrol excessive bleeding after delivery.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='THE UMBILICAL CORD\\nDevelopment\\nIn the early stages, the embryo has a thick embryonic stalk containing 2 umbilical arteries, 1 large\\numbilical vein, the allantois, and the primary mesoderm. The arteries carry blood from the embryo to\\nthe chorionic villi, and the umbilical vein returns blood to the embryo. The umbilical vein and 2\\narteries twist around one another.\\nIn the fifth week of gestation, the amnion expands to fill the entire extraembryonic coelom. This\\nprocess forces the yolk sac against the embryonic stalk and covers the entire contents with a tube of\\namniotic ectoderm, forming the umbilical cord. The cord is narrower in diameter than the embryonic\\nstalk and rapidly increases in length. The connective tissue of the umbilical cord is called \\nWharton’s\\njelly\\n and is derived from the primary mesoderm. The umbilical cord can be found in loops around the\\nbaby’s neck in approximately 23% of normal spontaneous vertex deliveries.\\nAt birth, the mature cord is approximately 50–60 cm in length and 12 mm in diameter. A long cord\\nis defined as more than 100 cm, and a short cord as less than 30 cm. There may be as many as 40\\nspiral twists in the cord, as well as false knots and true knots. When umbilical blood flow is\\ninterrupted at birth, the intraabdominal sections of the umbilical arteries and vein gradually become\\nfibrous cords. The course of the umbilical vein is discernible in the adult as a fibrous cord from the\\numbilicus to the liver (ligamentum teres) contained within the falciform ligament. The umbilical\\narteries are retained proximally as the internal iliac arteries and give off the superior vesicle arteries\\nand the medial umbilical \\nligaments within the medial umbilical folds to the umbilicus. When the\\numbilical cord is cut and the end examined at the time of delivery, the vessels ordinarily are\\ncollapsed.\\nAnalysis of the Umbilical Cord in Fetal Abnormalities\\nA segment of umbilical cord should be kept available as a source of umbilical cord blood for blood\\ngas measurements at the time of delivery. Cord blood gases are a more objective measure of\\noxygenation than Apgar scores.\\nABNORMALITIES OF THE UMBILICAL CORD\\nVelamentous Insertion\\nIn velamentous insertion, the umbilical vessels divide to course through the membranes before\\nreaching the chorionic plate. Velamentous insertion occurs in approximately 1% of placentas in\\nsingleton pregnancies, with multiple gestations having a 6–9 times higher incidence. When these\\nvessels present themselves ahead of the fetus (vasa previa), they may rupture during labor or before to\\ncause fetal exsanguination. When painless vaginal bleeding occurs, the blood may be tested to\\ndetermine whether it is of fetal origin (Apt test). In practical terms, a high index of suspicion for vasa\\nprevia is needed because the time to fetal collapse with bleeding from vasa previa is often too rapid to\\nallow test interpretation.\\nShort Umbilical Cord\\nIt appears from indirect evidence in the human fetus that the length of the umbilical cord at term is\\ndetermined by the amount of amniotic fluid present during the first and second trimesters and by the\\nmobility of the fetus.

Kelly, MD\\nA full-term newborn is a baby born at 37 weeks’ or more gestation. Term newborns are evaluated in\\nthe delivery room immediately after birth to assure that they do not require respiratory or circulatory\\nsupport, have no birth-related trauma or congenital anomalies requiring immediate intervention, and\\nare transitioning as expected to extrauterine life. Approximately 97% of newborns are healthy and\\nrequire only routine care in the nursery after birth. In the nursery, newborns receive a thorough\\nevaluation to determine maturity, evaluate growth and development, and identify those with signs of\\nacute illness or underlying congenital disease.\\nDELIVERY ROOM MANAGEMENT\\nAt every delivery there should be at least 1 person whose primary responsibility is attending to the\\nnewborn. Although approximately 90% of the time no resuscitation will be required, the attendant\\nmust be able to recognize signs of distress in a newborn and carry out a skilled resuscitation.\\nAfter the umbilical cord is cut, newborns should be placed in a warm environment. They may be\\nplaced on the mother’s chest, skin-to-skin, or they may be brought to a radiant warmer. Early skin-to-\\nskin contact increases the likelihood and duration of breastfeeding, decreases infant crying, and\\nfacilitates bonding and is therefore encouraged when possible. However, it should only be done when\\nthe newborn is crying/breathing and has good tone and when there are no risk factors that increase the\\nlikelihood that resuscitation will be required (eg, prematurity). The infant is dried with prewarmed\\ntowels to prevent heat loss and the airway is positioned and cleared to ensure patency. The airway may\\nbe cleared by suctioning the mouth and nares with a bulb syringe or a suction catheter connected to\\nmechanical suction. If the newborn is well-appearing and not at increased risk, the airway can be\\ncleared simply by wiping the mouth and nose with a towel.\\nDuring this initial postpartum period, the newborn’s respiratory effort, heart rate, color, and\\nactivity are evaluated to determine the need for intervention. If drying and suctioning do not provide\\nadequate stimulus, it is appropriate to flick the soles or rub the back to stimulate breathing. It is\\nimportant to note the presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid or on the newborn’s skin. Although\\nnot contraindicated, it is no longer recommended that the obstetrician routinely suction the\\noropharynx of an infant born with meconium-stained amniotic fluid upon delivery of the head. If a\\nnewborn is in distress or has depressed respiratory effort after delivery and there is evidence that\\nmeconium was passed in utero, it is appropriate to intubate and suction the trachea before stimulating\\nthe baby in any way. Meconium can block the airway, preventing the newborn lungs from filling with\\noxygen, a vital step in normal transitioning. However, if the attempted intubation is prolonged or\\nrepeatedly unsuccessful, it may be appropriate to omit tracheal suctioning in favor of initiating\\npositive pressure ventilation (PPV) in a depressed infant. Tracheal suctioning has not been shown to\\ndecrease the incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome or mortality rates in depressed infants born\\nthrough meconium-stained fluid. An active, crying, well-appearing newborn does not require\\nendotracheal intubation, regardless of the presence of meconium staining or the thickness of the'),\n",

Scores between 0 and 2 in each of 5 different categories are assigned\\nat 1 and 5 minutes of life. The score reflects the cardiorespiratory and neurologic status at those time\\npoints. If the score is <7 at 5 minutes, scores should be \\nassigned every 5 minutes until the baby has a\\nscore of 7 or greater or has reached 20 minutes of life. The Apgar score is not what determines the\\nneed for resuscitation. Although scores are based on the same elements used to evaluate the newborn’s\\nstatus, the assessment of the need for intervention with PPV should ideally already have been made by\\nthe time the 1-minute Apgar score is assigned. Studies do not show a correlation between a low 1-\\nminute Apgar score and outcome. However, the change between the scores at 1 and 5 minutes is a\\nmeaningful measure of the effectiveness of the resuscitation efforts, and a 5-minute score of 0–3 is\\nassociated with increased mortality in both preterm and full-term infants. It is important to know that\\nfactors such as prematurity, maternal medications, and congenital disease can adversely affect scores.\\nTable 9–1\\n. Apgar scoring.\\nThe Importance of the Prenatal & Intrapartum History\\nKnowledge of the prenatal and intrapartum history is essential for adequate care of the newborn. The\\nhistory should be reviewed before delivery (if possible), as it may alter care in the immediate'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='postpartum period. For example, information about the use of certain anesthetic drugs during labor\\nand delivery alerts those attending the delivery to the possibility of newborn respiratory depression\\nand allows them to anticipate a role for the use of naloxone in the resuscitation. Other important\\npieces of information are the presence of chronic disease in the mother (eg, diabetes mellitus, Grave’s\\ndisease, or systemic lupus erythematosus), maternal illicit or prescription drug use, prenatal\\nultrasound findings, maternal screening laboratory test results, and the presence of risk factors for\\nneonatal infection. All of these will affect how the newborn is monitored during the nursery admission\\nand in the first few weeks of life, and adequate care is not possible without them.\\nA. The Initial Exam\\nAlthough a complete and detailed physical exam is delayed until the newborn is admitted to the\\nnursery and has had time to transition to extrauterine life, a brief examination should be done shortly\\nafter delivery to rule out any problems that require immediate attention.\\n1. Airway\\n—The airway should be evaluated for patency. A suction catheter may be passed through\\neach naris if needed to remove secretions from the nasopharynx or if there is concern about the\\npossibility of choanal atresia, but is not necessary if adequate clearance of secretions is achieved with\\na bulb syringe and the newborn is breathing comfortably. Although a suction catheter is an effective\\nmeans of removing secretions, it should be used cautiously because it can induce bradycardia and\\ncause trauma and edema to the mucous membranes.\\n2. Chest\\n—The chest should be examined to determine the adequacy of the respiratory effort. One\\nshould assess chest wall movement, respiratory rate, and breathing pattern and look for signs of\\ndistress, such as retractions. Crackles are often audible initially, but should clear over time as fetal\\nlung fluid is resorbed and the lungs inflate with air. Decreased or asymmetric breath sounds may\\nresult from pneumonia, atelectasis, a pneumothorax, mass, or effusion. Heart rate and rhythm should\\nbe evaluated, and the presence or absence of a murmur noted. The heart rate should be >100\\nbeats/min.\\n3. Abdomen\\n—The abdomen should be soft and nondistended. A distended, firm abdomen may\\nindicate a bowel obstruction, pneumoperitoneum, or intraabdominal mass. A scaphoid abdomen, when\\naccompanied by respiratory distress, should raise the examiner’s suspicion of a diaphragmatic hernia.\\nThe umbilical stump should be examined and the number of blood vessels noted. A single umbilical\\nartery may be a clue to the presence of other anomalies, renal anomalies in particular.\\n4. Skin\\n—The skin color should be evaluated. Although acrocyanosis, bluish discoloration of the hands\\nand feet, may be seen in well newborns, central cyanosis of the trunk may be a sign that the newborn\\nis not receiving sufficient oxygen. Cyanosis and pallor can result from a wide variety of \\ncauses such\\nas sepsis, anemia, respiratory insufficiency with or without abnormally elevated cardiac vascular\\nresistance, congenital heart disease, and hypoxic-ischemic injury with cardiac dysfunction; the pre-\\nand intrapartum history is often useful in determining the etiology. Pulse oximetry is useful to help\\ndetermine the oxygen saturation in the event of cyanosis. A cyanotic infant with a normal heart rate\\nand respiratory effort may be given free-flow 100% oxygen by face mask or tubing held close to the\\nnose and should be observed for improvement in skin coloring. If the skin does not become pink, the\\npatient may require PPV to achieve improved oxygenation.\\n5. Genitalia\\n—It is important to closely evaluate the genitalia before pronouncing the sex of the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='newborn. If there is ambiguity of the genitalia, the situation must be explained to the parents, and a\\nfull evaluation, including karyotyping and consultation with a pediatric endocrinologist and urologist,\\nshould be done before gender assignment.\\n5. General\\n—Alertness, activity, tone, and movement of the extremities should be noted. The face and\\nextremities should be evaluated for evidence of congenital anomalies or birth trauma. The most\\ncommon birth-related injuries are nerve injuries (facial and brachial nerve palsies) and fractures\\n(primarily clavicular). Unilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy should be suspected when the newborn\\nhas normal movement of the forehead, but difficulty closing the eye and flattening of the nasolabial\\nfolds on the affected side and an asymmetric facial expression with crying (the unaffected side will go\\ndown). Peripheral facial nerve injury is thought to result from compression of the nerve against the\\nmaternal sacrum during delivery and is not associated with the use of forceps in delivery. The risk of\\nbrachial plexus injury is increased when there is shoulder dystocia or the baby is large for gestational\\nage (LGA). Erb’s palsy (C5–C6 injury) manifests as an inability to externally rotate or abduct the\\nshoulder; the affected arm is held adducted and internally rotated and is extended and pronated at the\\nelbow (“waiter-tip” position). If the C5–T1 nerve roots are all affected, the function of the hand will\\nbe affected as well.\\nCasey BM, McIntire DD, Leveno KJ.

Vitamin K prophylaxis has been standard of care since\\n1961, when it was first recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). Standard\\nnewborn care also includes applying either 0.5% erythromycin ointment, 1% silver nitrate solution, or\\n1% tetracycline ointment to the infant’s eyes shortly after birth to prevent infectious neonatal\\nconjunctivitis.\\nThe well newborn may remain with the mother after birth and attempt an initial feed. There should\\nbe continued intermittent assessment to assure that there is no cardiorespiratory distress, temperature\\ninstability, altered level of activity, or other signs of distress. It is important that care-givers are aware\\nthat babies that require resuscitation after birth are at increased risk of difficulties with transitioning\\nand must be monitored closely.'),\n",

PMID:\\n12837888.\\nNEWBORN NURSERY CARE\\nVital Signs\\nVital signs should be recorded by the nursing staff for all newborns admitted to the nursery. Body\\ntemperature is typically measured in the axilla. Fever, defined as a temperature ≥38.0° Celsius (or\\n100.4° Fahrenheit), is often caused by excessive environmental heat or overbundling when it occurs\\nshortly after birth. Hypothermia may result if newborns are left in the delivery room unbundled and\\noff the radiant warmer. A newborn with hypothermia or hyperthermia whose temperature fails to\\nnormalize in response to appropriate environmental measures should be evaluated for possible sepsis\\nand central nervous system pathology.\\nA normal respiratory rate for a newborn is typically between 40 and 60 breaths per minute. A\\nnormal heart rate for a newborn is generally 100–160 beats/min, but varies considerably with sleep\\nand activity level. If measured, pulse oximetry should be >95% in the term infant. However, it is\\nimportant to realize that oxygen saturations may remain low for several minutes after birth. Data\\nindicate that it takes approximately 8 minutes on average for pulse oxygen saturations to rise above\\n90%. Neonatal resuscitation guidelines published by the AAP in 2010 target a preductal saturation of\\n>80% by 5 minutes of life and 85–95% by 10 minutes of life in both term and preterm infants. Blood\\npressure varies with gestation and birth weight. There is still debate regarding what constitutes an\\nabnormal blood pressure in \\na neonate, but hypotension in the first 12–24 hours of life is typically\\ndefined as a mean blood pressure less than the gestational age. Hypertension in the full-term newborn\\nis defined as a systolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure >60 mm Hg and a\\nmean blood pressure >70 mm Hg. Blood pressures should be measured in all 4 extremities if there is\\nany suspicion of cardiac disease. Coarctation of the aorta is characterized by elevated blood pressure\\nin the upper extremities and decreased pressure in the lower extremities.\\nGrowth and Development\\nWeight, length, and head circumference should be measured and plotted on curves to assess\\nintrauterine growth (\\nFig. 9–1\\n). Newborns that are small for gestational age (SGA), historically defined\\nas less than the 10th percentile on the growth curve, may warrant evaluation for congenital infections,\\nchromosomal syndromes, or other causes if there is no identifiable cause for the growth retardation,\\nsuch as multiple pregnancy or preeclampsia or other evidence of placental insufficiency. Infants that\\nare SGA or LGA should be treated similarly to the infants of diabetic mothers and should be\\nmonitored for hypoglycemia in the first few hours of life.'),\n",

Other frequently seen benign rashes include milia, small white papules typically around the\\nnares, and transient neonatal pustular melanosis, small vesicles or pustules present at birth that leave\\npigmented macules surrounded by scale when they disappear.\\nHemangiomas and vascular malformations may be present at birth.

They\\neventually involute without therapy, but only after an initial period of growth, usually of 6–12 months.\\nIf present near the eyes or airways, they may require early intervention to prevent visual or airway\\ncompromise.

Pupils should be equal and reactive.\\nAbnormalities of the positioning or formation of the eyes, nose, or ears may suggest specific\\nsyndromes or chromosomal defects. Although preauricular tags and pits have been associated with\\nrenal malformations, there is no current evidence to suggest that their presence, when an isolated\\nfinding, is sufficient to warrant a renal ultrasound. The neck should be examined for masses, cysts,\\nand webbing. The clavicles should be palpated for crepitus, swelling, and tenderness, which would\\nsuggest an underlying fracture. Although not usually detected until several weeks of age, torticollis\\nmay occur as a result of ischemia within, or hemorrhage into, the sternocleidomastoid muscle at birth.\\nIt manifests as a head tilt with or without a fibrous mass palpable in the muscle. Surgery is rarely\\nnecessary; the overwhelming majority of cases are managed with a home stretching regimen or\\nphysical therapy.\\nC. Chest\\nThe chest should be evaluated for deformities such as widely spaced or accessory nipples and pectus\\nexcavatum. Breast buds may be present in both sexes and are normal, a product of exposure to\\ncirculating maternal hormones in utero.\\nThe respiratory effort and rate should be evaluated, looking for signs of respiratory distress. Early\\non, tachypnea may be the only sign of pathologic processes as varied as pneumonia, amniotic fluid\\nand/or meconium aspiration syndrome, sepsis, or congenital heart disease (CHD). Breath sounds are\\nauscultated, paying attention to the quality of the breath sounds, the air entry, and any asymmetry that\\nis present across the lung fields. Asymmetry of the breath sounds may indicate an area of\\nconsolidation from atelectasis or infection, a pneumothorax, effusion, or mass. Upper airway sounds,\\nsuch as congestion or stridor, are often mistaken for abnormal breath sounds on exam. The listener can\\nusually distinguish noises of upper airway origin from those of intrathoracic origin by listening for the\\npresence of the sounds over the patient’s neck. Respiratory distress or an abnormal lung exam should\\nbe evaluated with a chest radiograph. In an emergency situation in which a pneumothorax is\\nsuspected, a transilluminator may be used. Transillumination is increased over the side of a\\npneumothorax, but it is sometimes difficult to assess accurately and should be confirmed by chest\\nradiograph when possible before needle aspiration or chest tube placement.\\nA hyperdynamic precordium may indicate underlying heart disease with volume overload to one or\\nboth ventricles. The heart is auscultated to evaluate the heart rate and rhythm and characterize the\\nheart sounds. A split-second heart sound can assure the examiner that both the aortic and pulmonary\\nvalves are present. A murmur should be \\ndescribed by where it is heard, what it sounds like, if it occurs\\nin systole or diastole, and how loud it is. Murmurs are often audible in the newborn and are frequently\\ninnocent. Innocent murmurs are often attributed to a closing ductus arteriosus or foramen ovale, but\\nthe most commonly heard innocent murmur in the neonate is produced by peripheral pulmonic\\nstenosis (PPS). PPS murmurs occur during systole and are best heard over the back or axillae.\\nMurmurs may or may not be present in newborns with CHD. Ventricular septal defects, the most\\ncommon form of CHD, have a characteristic harsh, systolic murmur associated with them. However,\\nthe pressures in the newborn pulmonary system are still high (roughly equal to systemic pressures),\\nand thus there is usually no flow gradient across a large ventricular defect to produce a murmur in the\\nfirst few days of life.

The diagnosis of CHD is usually established by echocardiogram.\\nD. Abdomen\\nThe examiner should listen for bowel sounds and palpate the abdomen for masses, organomegaly, or\\nabnormal musculature. The liver is easily palpable in the newborn and the inferior edge is usually 1–2\\ncm below the right costal margin. It is often possible to palpate the kidneys and spleen. Absence of the\\nabdominal musculature may be associated with significant urinary tract abnormalities. The umbilical\\nstump should be assessed for redness or induration that may suggest the presence of an infection.\\nUmbilical hernias are common and typically require no intervention in infancy. Omphalocele and\\ngastroschisis are major abdominal wall defects and require emergent surgical evaluation.\\nOmphalocele is a midline abdominal wall defect. Bowel, and often liver, herniate through the defect,\\nand the umbilicus is typically on the anterior aspect of the omphalocele. Unless ruptured, an\\nomphalocele is covered by a membrane. Omphalocele is associated with aneuploidies, certain genetic\\nsyndromes such as pentalogy of Cantrell, and other congenital structural malformations. The defect in\\ngastroschisis is typically to the right of the umbilicus on the abdominal wall, and the etiology of the\\ndefect is thought to be due to vascular interruption. The entire bowel may be externalized, but the liver\\ntypically remains internal. Unlike omphaloceles, the externalized bowel is not covered by a\\nmembrane. Other bowel abnormalities such as bowel atresias and malrotation of the bowel may be\\npresent in infants with gastroschisis. Fetuses with gastroschisis are also at increased risk of\\ndeveloping intrauterine growth restriction.\\nE. Genitalia\\nThe penile length and clitoral size should be inspected to rule out ambiguous genitalia. The labia\\nmajora should cover the labia minora and clitoris in a term female. White mucouslike discharge from\\nthe vagina is often present and is physiologic.\\nThe scrotum should be evaluated for hernias or masses and descent of the testicles.\\nTransillumination of the scrotum will help to distinguish a hydrocele from an inguinal hernia. The\\nposition of the urethral meatus is important to note, as the presence of hypospadias should preclude\\nroutine circumcision to allow for optimal surgical correction of the hypospadias.\\nF. Anus\\nThe rectum should be evaluated for patency and position. An anteriorly displaced rectum may be\\nassociated with a rectogenital fistula.\\nG. Musculoskeletal System\\nThe extremities, spine, and hips are examined for signs of fracture, malformation, or deformation.\\nRange of motion of the joints is assessed. Arthrogryposis, contractures of the joints, may be seen with\\nneuromuscular disease or oligohydramnios as a result of decreased or limited movement in utero.\\nAbnormalities of the extremities, such as polydactyly or syndactyly, are seen in different\\nchromosomal abnormalities and syndromes and may help in making the diagnosis. Particular attention\\nshould be paid to the examination of the hips (despite the fact that a dislocation may not be detectable\\nin the first weeks of life) because developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) can cause permanent\\ndamage if left undetected throughout the first year of life.

Asymmetry of the gluteal folds\\nand skin creases of the legs is another clue to the presence of DDH.\\nH. Neurologic System\\nObserving the activity level, alertness, and positioning of the newborn provides a tremendous amount\\nof information about the overall state of health. A healthy, full-term newborn at rest should lie with\\nthe extremities flexed. Decreased tone may be a sign of neuromuscular or systemic illness such as\\nsepsis. There should be spontaneous intermittent movement of all 4 limbs, and the baby should be\\nalert during at least portions of the examination. Pupil size and symmetry should be noted. Primitive\\nreflexes such as the Moro, grasp, \\nsuck, and tonic neck reflex should all be present at birth. To elicit\\nthe Moro reflex, the newborn is supported with a hand under the back and then rapidly dropped a few\\ncentimeters back toward the examination bed. The full Moro reflex consists of extension and then\\nflexion and adduction of the arms (“embrace”), opening of the eyes, and a cry. Reflexes are elicited by\\ntapping a finger over the appropriate tendon. Significant clonus may be a sign of central nervous\\nsystem injury. A sacral dimple or tuft of hair over the sacral spine may indicate spina bifida occulta\\nand should be evaluated with a spinal ultrasound; if the findings of the ultrasound are equivocal, a\\nmagnetic resonance imaging scan should be done at approximately 3 months of age.\\nFeeding\\nThe benefits of breastfeeding on everything from the strength of the immune system to developmental\\noutcomes and IQ have been well documented. Human milk is the most easily digested form of infant\\nnutrition, and its caloric value is superior to formula. Mothers should be counseled prenatally about\\nthe benefits of breastfeeding and encouraged by their obstetric caregivers to consider breastfeeding.\\nContraindications to breastfeeding include HIV infection, active tuberculosis infection, and the use of\\ncertain medications. Maternal hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is not a contraindication to\\nbreastfeeding. Transmission of HCV via breastmilk is not documented in the absence of coexisting\\nmaternal infection with HIV.

The postpartum period has been arbitrarily divided into the\\nimmediate puerperium, or the first 24 hours after parturition, when acute postanesthetic or\\npostdelivery complications may occur; the early puerperium, which extends until the first week\\npostpartum; and the remote puerperium, which includes the period of time required for involution of\\nthe genital organs and return of menses, usually approximately 6 weeks.\\nANATOMIC & PHYSIOLOGIC CHANGES DURING THE PUERPERIUM\\nUterine Involution\\nThe uterus increases markedly in size and weight during pregnancy (approximately 10 times the\\nnonpregnant weight, reaching a crude weight of 1000 g) but involutes rapidly after delivery to the\\nnonpregnant weight of 50–100 g.

Ovulation occurs as early as 27 days after delivery, with a mean time of 70–\\n75 days in nonlactating women and 6 months in lactating women.

Involution of the abdominal\\nmusculature may require 6–7 weeks, and vigorous exercise is not recommended until after that time.\\nUrinary System\\nIn the immediate postpartum period, the bladder mucosa is edematous as a result of labor and\\ndelivery. In addition, bladder capacity is increased. Overdistention and incomplete emptying of the\\nbladder with the presence of residual urine are therefore common problems. The decreased bladder\\nsensibility induced by intrapartum regional analgesia may lead to postpartum urinary retention;\\nhowever, it is reversible and usually not detrimental to later urinary function. Nearly 50% of patients\\nhave a mild proteinuria for 1–2 days after delivery. Ultrasonographic examination demonstrates\\nresolution of collecting system dilatation by 6 weeks postpartum in most women. Urinary stasis,\\nhowever, may persist in more than 50% of women at 12 weeks postpartum. The incidence of urinary\\ntract infection is generally higher in women with persistent dilatation. Significant renal enlargement\\nmay persist for many weeks postpartum.\\nPregnancy is accompanied by an estimated increase of approximately 50% in the glomerular\\nfiltration rate. These values return to normal or less than normal during the eighth week of the\\npuerperium. Endogenous creatinine clearance similarly returns to normal by 8 weeks. Renal plasma\\nflow, which increased during pregnancy by 25% in the first trimester, falls in the third trimester and\\ncontinues to fall to below normal levels for up to 24 months. Normal levels return slowly over 50–60\\nweeks. The glucosuria induced by pregnancy disappears. The blood urea nitrogen rises during the\\npuerperium; at the end of the first week postpartum, values of 20 mg/dL are reached, compared with\\n15 mg/dL in the late third trimester.\\nFluid Balance & Electrolytes\\nAn average decrease in maternal weight of 10–13 lb occurs intrapartum and immediately postpartum\\ndue to the loss of amniotic fluid and blood as well as delivery of the infant and placenta. The average\\npatient may lose an additional 4 kg (9 lb) during the puerperium and over the next 6 months as a result\\nof excretion of the fluids and electrolytes accumulated during pregnancy. Contrary to widespread\\nbelief, breastfeeding has minimal effects on hastening weight loss postpartum. The magnitude of\\nweight gain during pregnancy has impact on the postpartum weight retention. Women who gain more\\nweight than the recommended range during the pregnancy tend to be heavier at 3 years postpartum\\nthan women who gained weight within recommended range during pregnancy, and this applies to both\\nobese and nonobese patients.\\nThere is an average net fluid loss of at least 2 L during the first week postpartum and an additional\\nloss of approximately 1.5 L during the next 5 weeks. The water loss in the first week postpartum\\nrepresents a loss of extracellular fluid. A negative balance must be expected of slightly more than 100\\nmEq of chloride per kilogram of body weight lost in the early puerperium. This negative balance\\nprobably is attributable to the discharge of maternal extracellular fluid. The puerperal losses of salt\\nand water are generally larger in women with preeclampsia or eclampsia.\\nThe changes occurring in serum electrolytes during the puerperium indicate a general increase in\\nthe numbers of cations and anions compared with antepartum values. Although total exchangeable\\nsodium decreases during the puerperium, the relative decrease in body water exceeds the sodium loss.\\nThe diminished aldosterone antagonism due to falling plasma progesterone concentrations may\\npartially explain the rapid rise in serum sodium.

The mean increase in\\ncations, chiefly sodium, amounts to 4.7 mEq/L, with an equal increase in anions. Consequently, the\\nplasma osmolality rises by 7 mOsm/L at the end of the first week postpartum. In keeping with the\\nchloride shift, there is a tendency for the serum chloride concentration to decrease slightly postpartum\\nas serum bicarbonate concentration increases.\\nMetabolic & Chemical Changes\\nTotal fatty acids and nonesterified fatty acids return to non-pregnant levels on about the second day of\\nthe puerperium. Both cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations decrease significantly within 24\\nhours after delivery, and this change is reflected in all lipoprotein fractions. Plasma triglycerides\\ncontinue to fall and approach nonpregnant values 6–7 weeks postpartum. By comparison, the decrease\\nin plasma cholesterol levels is slower; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol remains above nonpregnant\\nlevels for at least 7 weeks postpartum. Lactation does not influence lipid levels, but, in contrast to\\npregnancy, the postpartum hyperlipidemia is sensitive to dietary manipulation.\\nDuring the early puerperium, blood glucose concentrations (both fasting and postprandial) tend to\\nfall below the values seen during pregnancy and delivery. This fall is most marked on the second and\\nthird postpartum days. Accordingly, the insulin requirements of diabetic patients are lower. Reliable\\nindications of the insulin sensitivity and the blood glucose concentrations characteristic of the non-\\npregnant state can be demonstrated only after the first week postpartum. Thus a glucose tolerance test\\nperformed in the early puerperium may be interpreted erroneously if nonpuerperal standards are\\napplied to the results.\\nThe concentration of free plasma amino acids increases postpartum. Normal nonpregnant values\\nare regained rapidly on the second or third postpartum day and are presumably a result of reduced\\nutilization and an elevation in the renal threshold.\\nCardiovascular Changes\\nA. Blood Coagulation\\nThe production of both prostacyclin (prostaglandin I\\n2\\n [PGI\\n2\\n]), an inhibitor of platelet aggregation, and\\nthromboxane A\\n2\\n, an inducer of platelet aggregation and a vasoconstrictor, is increased during\\npregnancy and the puerperium. Possibly, the balance between thromboxane A\\n2\\n and PGI\\n2\\n is shifted to\\nthe side of thromboxane A\\n2\\n dominance during the puerperium because platelet reactivity is increased\\nat this time. Rapid and dramatic changes in the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems occur after\\ndelivery (\\nTable 10–1\\n). A decrease in the fibrinogen concentration begins during labor and reaches its\\nlowest point during the first day postpartum. Thereafter, rising plasma fibrinogen levels reach\\nprelabor values by the third or fifth day of the puerperium. This secondary peak in fibrinogen activity\\nis maintained until the second postpartum week, after which the level of activity slowly returns to\\nnormal nonpregnant levels during the following 7–10 days. A similar pattern occurs with respect to\\nfactor VIII and plasminogen. Circulating levels of antithrombin III are decreased in the third trimester\\nof pregnancy. Patients with a congenital deficiency of antithrombin III (an endogenous inhibitor of\\nfactor X) have recurrent venous thromboembolic disease, and a low level of this factor has been\\nassociated with a hypercoagulable state.\\nTable 10–1\\n.

The level of protein S, both total and\\nfree, increases on the first day after delivery \\nand gradually returns to normal levels after the first week\\npostpartum.\\nThe increased concentration of clotting factors normally seen during pregnancy can be viewed as\\nimportant reserve to compensate for the rapid consumption of these factors during delivery and in\\npromoting hemostasis after parturition. Nonetheless, extensive activation of clotting factors, together\\nwith immobility, sepsis, or trauma during delivery, may set the stage for later thromboembolic\\ncomplications (see \\nChapter 27\\n). The secondary increase in fibrinogen, factor VIII, or platelets (which\\nremain well above nonpregnant values in the first week postpartum) also predisposes to thrombosis\\nduring the puerperium. The abrupt return of normal fibrinolytic activity after delivery may be a\\nprotective mechanism to combat this hazard. A small percentage of puerperal women who show a\\ndiminished ability to activate the fibrinolytic system appear to be at high risk for the development of\\npostpartum thromboembolic complications.\\nB. Blood Volume Changes\\nThe total blood volume normally decreases from the antepartum value of 5–6 L to the nonpregnant\\nvalue of 4 L by the third week after delivery. One-third of this reduction occurs during delivery and\\nsoon afterward, and a similar amount is lost by the end of the first postpartum week. Additional\\nvariation occurs with lactation. The volume expansion with increased water retention in the\\nextracellular space during pregnancy may be viewed as a protective mechanism that allows most\\nwomen to tolerate considerable blood loss during parturition. Normal vaginal delivery of a single\\nfetus entails an average blood loss of approximately 400 mL, whereas caesarean section leads to a\\nblood loss of nearly 1 L. If total hysterectomy is performed in addition to caesarean section delivery,\\nthe mean blood loss increases to approximately 1500 mL. Delivery of twins and triplets entails blood\\nlosses similar to those of operative delivery, but a compensatory increase in maternal plasma volume\\nand red blood cell mass may be exacerbated in mothers carrying multiple gestations.\\nDramatic and rapid readjustments occur in the maternal vasculature after delivery so that the\\nresponse to blood loss during the early puerperium is different from that occurring in the nonpregnant\\nwoman. Delivery leads to obliteration of the low-resistance uteroplacental circulation and results in a\\n10–15% reduction in the size of the maternal vascular bed. Loss of placental endocrine function also\\nremoves a stimulus to vasodilatation.\\nA declining blood volume with a rise in hematocrit is usually seen 3–7 days after vaginal delivery\\n(\\nFig. 10–3\\n). In contrast, serial studies of patients after caesarean section indicate a more rapid decline\\nin blood volume and hematocrit and a tendency for the hematocrit to stabilize or even decline in the\\nearly puerperium. Hemoconcentration occurs if the loss of red cells is less than the reduction in\\nvascular capacity. Hemodilution takes place in patients who lose 20% or more of their circulating\\nblood volume at delivery. In patients with preeclampsia–eclampsia, resolution of peripheral\\nvasoconstriction and mobilization of excess extracellular fluid may lead to significant expansion of\\nvascular volume by the third postpartum day. Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels nearly double\\nduring the first days postpartum in response to atrial stretch caused by blood volume expansion and\\nmay have relevance for postpartum natriuresis and diuresis. Occasionally, a patient sustains minimal\\nblood loss at delivery. In such a patient, marked hemoconcentration may occur in the puerperium,\\nespecially if there has been a preexisting polycythemia or a considerable increase in the red cell mass\\nduring pregnancy.'),\n",

In the\\nimmediate puerperium, the white blood cell count may be as high as 25,000/mL, with \\nan increased\\npercentage of granulocytes. The stimulus for this leukocytosis is not known, but it probably represents\\na release of sequestered cells in response to the stress of labor.\\nThe serum iron level is decreased and the plasma iron turnover is increased between the third and\\nfifth days of the puerperium. Normal values are regained by the second week postpartum. The shorter\\nduration of ferrokinetic changes in puerperal women compared with the duration of changes in\\nnonpregnant women who have had phlebotomy is due to the increased erythroid marrow activity and\\nthe circulatory changes described previously.\\nMost women who sustain an average blood loss at delivery and who received iron supplementation\\nduring pregnancy show a relative erythrocytosis during the second week postpartum. Because there is\\nno evidence of increased red cell destruction during the puerperium, any red cells gained during\\npregnancy will disappear gradually according to their normal life span. A moderate excess of red\\nblood cells after delivery, therefore, may lead to an increase in iron stores.

Hemodynamic Changes\\nThe hemodynamic adjustments in the puerperium depend largely on the conduct of labor and delivery\\n(eg, maternal position, method of delivery, mode of anesthesia or analgesia, and blood loss). Cardiac\\noutput increases progressively during labor in patients who have received only local anesthesia. The\\nincrease in cardiac output peaks immediately after delivery, at which time it is approximately 80%\\nabove the prelabor value. During a uterine contraction there is a rise in central venous pressure,\\narterial pressure, and stroke volume—and, in the absence of pain and anxiety, a reflex decrease in the\\npulse rate. These changes are magnified in the supine position. Only minimal changes occur in the\\nlateral recumbent position because of unimpaired venous return and absence of aortoiliac compression\\nby the contracting uterus (Poseiro’s effect). Epidural anesthesia can interfere with the hemodynamic\\nchange by attenuating the progressive rise in cardiac output during labor and reduces the absolute\\nincrease observed immediately after delivery, probably by limiting pain, anxiety, and oxygen\\nconsumption.\\nAlthough major hemodynamic readjustments occur during the period immediately after delivery,\\nthere is a return to nonpregnant conditions in the early puerperium. A trend for normal women to\\nincrease their blood pressure slightly in the first 5 days postpartum reflects an increased uterine\\nvascular resistance and a temporary surplus in plasma volume. A small percentage will have diastolic\\nblood pressures of 100 mm Hg. Cardiac output (measured by Doppler and cross-sectional\\nechocardiography) declines 28% within 2 weeks postpartum from peak values observed at 38 weeks’\\ngestation. This change is associated with a 20% reduction in stroke volume and a smaller decrease in\\nmyocardial contractility indices. Postpartum resolution of pregnancy-induced ventricular hypertrophy\\ntakes longer than the functional postpartum changes (\\nFig. 10–4\\n).

An increase in resting ventilation and oxygen consumption\\nand a less efficient response to exercise may persist during the early postpartum weeks. Comparisons\\nof aerobic capacity before pregnancy and again postpartum indicate that lack of activity and weight\\ngain contribute to a generalized detraining effect 4–8 weeks postpartum.\\nChanges in acid–base status generally parallel changes in respiratory function. The state of\\npregnancy is characterized by respiratory alkalosis and compensated metabolic acidosis, whereas\\nlabor represents a transitional period. A significant hypocapnia (<30 mm Hg), a rise in blood lactate,\\nand a fall in pH are first noted at the end of the first stage of labor and extend into the puerperium.\\nWithin a few days, a rise toward the normal nonpregnant values of PCO\\n2\\n (35–40 mm Hg) occurs.\\nProgesterone influences the rate of ventilation by means of a central effect, and rapidly decreasing\\nlevels of this hormone are largely responsible for the increased PCO\\n2\\n seen in the first week\\npostpartum. An increase in base excess and plasma bicarbonate accompanies the relative postpartum\\nhypercapnia. A gradual increase in pH and base excess occurs until normal levels are reached at\\napproximately 3 weeks postpartum.\\nThe resting arterial PO\\n2\\n and oxygen saturation during pregnancy are higher than those in\\nnonpregnant women. During labor, the oxygen saturation may be depressed, especially in the supine\\nposition, probably as a result of a decrease in cardiac output and a relative increase in the amount of\\nintrapulmonary shunting. However, a rise in the arterial oxygen saturation to 95% is noted during the\\nfirst postpartum day. An apparent oxygen debt incurred during labor extends into the immediate\\npuerperium and appears to depend on the length and severity of the second stage of labor. Many\\ninvestigators have commented on the continued elevation of the basal metabolic rate for a period of 7–\\n14 days after delivery. The increased resting oxygen consumption in the early puerperium has been\\nattributed to mild anemia, lactation, and psychologic factors.\\nPituitary–Ovarian Relationships\\nThe plasma levels of placental hormones decline rapidly after delivery. Human placental lactogen has\\na half-life of 20 minutes and reaches undetectable levels in maternal plasma during the first day after\\ndelivery. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has a mean half-life of approximately 9 hours. The\\nconcentration of hCG in maternal plasma falls below 1000 mU/mL within 48–96 hours postpartum\\nand falls below 100 mU/mL by the seventh day. Highly specific and sensitive radioimmunoassay for\\nthe subunit of hCG indicates virtual disappearance of hCG from maternal plasma between the 11th\\nand 16th days after normal delivery. The regressive pattern of hCG activity is slower after first-\\ntrimester abortion than it is after term delivery and even more prolonged in patients who have\\nundergone suction curettage for molar pregnancy.\\nWithin 3 hours after removal of the placenta, the plasma concentration of 17β-estradiol falls to\\n10% of the antepartum value. The lowest levels are reached by the seventh postpartum day. Plasma\\nestrogens do not reach follicular phase levels (>50 pg/mL) until 19–21 days postpartum in\\nnonlactating women. The return to normal plasma levels of estrogens is delayed in lactating women.\\nLactating women who resume spontaneous menses achieve follicular-phase estradiol levels (>50\\npg/mL) during the first 60–80 days postpartum. Lactating amenorrheic persons are markedly\\nhypoestrogenic (plasma estradiol <10 pg/mL) during the first 180 days postpartum. The onset of\\nbreast engorgement on days 3–4 of the puerperium coincides with a significant fall in estrogen levels\\nand supports the view that high estrogen levels suppress lactation.\\nThe metabolic clearance rate of progesterone is high, and, as with estradiol, the half-life is'),\n",

(Reproduced, with permission, from Reyes FI, Winter JS, Faiman C. Pituitary-\\novarian interrelationships during the puerperium. \\nAm J Obstet Gynecol\\n 1972;114:589.)\\nSerum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) concentrations are very\\nlow in all women during the first 10–12 days postpartum, whether or not they lactate. The levels\\nincrease over the subsequent days and reach follicular-phase concentrations during the third week\\npostpartum (\\nFig. 10–5\\n). At this time, marked LH pulse amplification occurs during sleep but\\ndisappears as normal ovulatory cycles are established. In this respect, the transition from postpartum\\namenorrhea to cyclic ovulation is reminiscent of \\npuberty, when gonadotropin secretion increases\\nduring sleep. There is a preferential release of FSH over LH postpartum during spontaneous recovery\\nor after stimulation by exogenous gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). In the early puerperium,\\nthe pituitary is relatively refractory to GnRH, but 4–8 weeks postpartum, the response to GnRH is\\nexaggerated. The low levels of FSH and LH postpartum are most likely related to insufficient\\nendogenous GnRH secretion during pregnancy and the early puerperium, resulting in depletion of\\npituitary gonadotropin stores. The high estrogen and progesterone milieu of late pregnancy is\\nassociated with increased endogenous opioid activity, which may be responsible for \\nsuppression of\\nGnRH activity in the puerperium. Resumption of FSH and LH secretion can be accelerated by\\nadministering a long-acting GnRH agonist during the first 10 days postpartum.\\nBecause ovarian activity normally resumes upon weaning, either the suckling stimulus itself or the\\nraised level of prolactin is responsible for suppression of pulsatile gonadotropin secretion.\\nHyperprolactinemia may not entirely account for the inhibition of gonadotropin secretion during\\nlactation, as bromocriptine treatment abolishes the hyperprolactinemia of suckling but not the\\ninhibition of gonadotropin secretion. Sensory inputs associated with suckling (if sufficiently intense),\\nas well as oxytocin and endogenous opioids that are released during suckling, may affect the\\nhypothalamic control of gonadotropin secretion, possibly by inhibiting the pulsatile secretion of\\nGnRH. It appears that by 8 weeks after delivery, although ovarian activity still remains suppressed in\\nfully breastfeeding women, pulsatile secretion of LH has resumed at a low and variable frequency in\\nmost women. However, the presence or absence of GnRH or LH pulses at 8 weeks does not predict the\\ntime of resumption of ovarian activity.\\nThe time of appearance of the first ovulation is variable, and it is delayed by breastfeeding.\\nApproximately 10–15% of non-nursing mothers ovulate by the time of the 6-week postpartum\\nexamination, and approximately 30% ovulate within 90 days postpartum. An abnormally short luteal\\nphase is noted in 35% of first ovulatory cycles. The earliest reported time of ovulation as determined\\nby endometrial biopsy is 33 days postpartum. Patients who have had a first-trimester abortion or\\nectopic pregnancy generally ovulate sooner after termination of pregnancy (as early as 14 days) than\\ndo women who deliver at term. Moreover, the majority of these women do ovulate before the first\\nepisode of postabortal bleeding—in contrast to women who have had a term pregnancy.\\nEndometrial biopsies in lactating women do not show a secretory pattern before the seventh\\npostpartum week. Provided that nursing is in progress and that menstruation has not returned,\\novulation before the tenth week postpartum is rare. In well-nourished women who breastfed for an\\nextended period of time, fewer than 20% had ovulated by 6 months postpartum.

This emphasizes the fact that suckling is not a reliable form of birth control.\\nBecause the period of lactational infertility is relatively short in Western societies, some form of\\ncontraception must be used if pregnancy is to be prevented. Among women who have unprotected\\nintercourse only during lactational amenorrhea but adopt other contraceptive measures when they\\nresume menstruation, only 2% will become pregnant during the first 6 months of amenorrhea. In\\nunderdeveloped countries, lactational amenorrhea and infertility may persist for 1–2 years owing to\\nfrequent suckling and poor maternal nutrition. When maternal dietary intake is improved,\\nmenstruation resumes at least 6 months earlier.\\nOther Endocrine Changes\\nProgressive enlargement of the pituitary gland occurs during pregnancy, with a 30–100% increase in\\nweight achieved at term. Magnetic resonance imaging shows a linear gain in pituitary gland height of\\napproximately 0.08 mm/wk during pregnancy. An additional increase in size occurs during the first\\nweek postpartum. Beyond the first week postpartum, however, the pituitary gland returns rapidly to its\\nnormal size in both lactating and nonlactating women.\\nThe physiologic hypertrophy of the pituitary gland is associated with an increase in the number of\\npituitary lactotroph cells at the expense of the somatotropic cell types. Thus growth hormone secretion\\nis depressed during the second half of pregnancy and the early puerperium. Because levels of\\ncirculating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 increase throughout pregnancy, a placental growth\\nhormone has been postulated and recently identified. Maternal levels of IGF-1 correlate highly with\\nthis distinct placental growth hormone variant, but not with placental lactogen during pregnancy and\\nin the immediate puerperium.\\nLate pregnancy and the early puerperium are also characterized by pituitary somatotroph\\nhyporesponsiveness to growth hormone-releasing hormone and to insulin stimulation. Whatever the\\ninhibitory mechanism may be (possibly increased somatostatin secretion), it persists during the early\\npostpartum period.\\nThe rapid disappearance of placental lactogen and the low levels of growth hormone after delivery\\nlead to a relative deficiency of anti-insulin factors in the early puerperium. It is not surprising,\\ntherefore, that low fasting plasma glucose levels are noted at this time and that the insulin\\nrequirements of diabetic patients usually drop after delivery. Glucose tolerance tests performed in\\nwomen with gestational diabetes demonstrate that only 30% have abnormal test results 3–5 days after\\ndelivery, and 20% have abnormal glucose tolerance at 6 weeks postpartum. Because the early\\npuerperium represents a transitional period in carbohydrate metabolism, the results of glucose\\ntolerance tests may be difficult to interpret.\\nEvaluation of thyroid function is also difficult in the period immediately after birth because of\\nrapid fluctuations in many indices. Characteristically, the plasma thyroxine level and other indices of\\nthyroid function are highest at delivery and in the first 12 hours thereafter. A decrease to antepartum\\nvalues is seen on the third or fourth day after delivery. Reduced available estrogens postpartum lead to\\na subsequent decrease in circulating thyroxine-binding globulin and a gradual diminution in bound\\nthyroid hormones in serum. Serum concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are not\\nsignificantly different postpartum from \\nthose of the pregnant or nonpregnant state. Administration of\\nthyroid-releasing hormone in the puerperium results in a normal increase in both TSH and prolactin,\\nand the response is similar in lactating and nonlactating patients.

In Sheehan’s syndrome of pituitary infarction, postpartum cachexia and\\nmyxedema are seen secondary to anterior hypophyseal insufficiency.\\nMaternal concentrations of total and unbound (free) plasma cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone\\n(ACTH), immunoreactive corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and β-endorphin rise progressively\\nduring pregnancy and increase further during labor. Plasma 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels increase\\nfrom a concentration of 4–14 μg/dL at 40 weeks’ gestation. A 2- to 3-fold increase is seen during\\nlabor. ACTH, CRH, and β-endorphin decrease rapidly after delivery and return to nonpregnant levels\\nwithin 24 hours. Prelabor cortisol values are regained on the first day postpartum, but a return to\\nnormal, nonpregnant cortisol and 17-hydroxycorticosteroid levels is not reached until the end of the\\nfirst week postpartum.\\nMuch of the rise in total cortisol (but not in the unbound fraction) can be explained by the parallel\\nincrease in corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG) during pregnancy. Displacement of cortisol from\\nCBG by high concentrations of progesterone cannot account for the increased free cortisol levels\\nbecause saliva progesterone levels (a measure of the unbound hormone) do not fluctuate, whereas a\\nnormal diurnal rhythm of saliva cortisol is maintained during pregnancy and postpartum. An\\nextrapituitary source of ACTH, a progesterone-modulated decrease in the hypothalamic–pituitary\\nsensitivity to glucocorticoid feedback inhibition, and an extrahypothalamic (eg, placental) source of\\nCRH have been suggested as explanations for elevated plasma ACTH levels and the inability of\\ndexamethasone to completely suppress ACTH in pregnant women.\\nIn the third trimester, the placenta produces large amounts of CRH, which is released into the\\nmaternal circulation and may contribute to the hypercortisolemia of pregnancy. Present evidence\\nsuggests that it stimulates the maternal pituitary to produce ACTH while desensitizing the pituitary to\\nfurther acute stimulation with CRH. Maternal hypothalamic control of ACTH production is retained\\n(perhaps mediated by vasopressin secretion); this permits a normal response to stress and a persistent\\ndiurnal rhythm.\\nOverall, it is most likely that under the influence of rising estrogens and progesterone, there is a\\nresetting of the hypothalamic–pituitary sensitivity to cortisol feedback during pregnancy, which\\npersists for several days postpartum. Several studies have suggested a relationship between\\nperipartum alterations in maternal levels of cortisol and β-endorphin and the development of postnatal\\nmood disturbances.\\nThe excretion of urinary 17-ketosteroids is elevated in late pregnancy as a result of an increase in\\nandrogenic precursors from the fetoplacental unit and the ovary. An additional increase of 50% in\\nexcretion occurs during labor. Excretion of 17-ketosteroids returns to antepartum levels on the first\\nday after delivery and to the nonpregnant range by the end of the first week. The mean levels of\\ntestosterone during the third trimester of pregnancy range from 3 to 7 times the mean values for\\nnonpregnant women. The elevated levels of testosterone decrease after parturition parallel with the\\ngradual fall in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG). Androstenedione, which is poorly bound to\\nSHBG, falls rapidly to nonpregnant values by the third day postpartum. Conversely, the postpartum\\nplasma concentration of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate remains lower than that of nonpregnant\\nwomen, because its metabolic clearance rate continues to be elevated in the early puerperium.\\nPersistently elevated levels of 17-ketosteroids or androgens during the puerperium are an indication\\nfor investigation of ovarian abnormalities. Plasma renin and angiotensin II levels fall during the first 2\\nhours postpartum to levels within the normal nonpregnant range. This suggests that an extra-renal\\nsource of renin has been lost with the expulsion of the fetus and placenta.\\nThere is little direct information about the puerperal changes in numerous other hormones,\\nincluding aldosterone, parathyroid hormone, and calcitonin.

Only 3% of women with a\\nvaginal delivery and 9% of women having a caesarean section have a childbirth-related complication\\nrequiring prolonged postpartum hospitalization or readmission. Although a significant \\namount of\\nsymptomatic morbidity may exist postpartum (painful perineum, breastfeeding difficulties, urinary\\ninfections, urinary and fecal incontinence, and headache), most women can return home safely 2 days\\nafter normal vaginal delivery if proper education and instructions are given, if confidence exists with\\ninfant care and feeding, and if adequate support exists at home. Earlier discharge is acceptable in\\nselect mothers and infants who have had uncomplicated labors and deliveries. Discharge criteria\\nshould be met and follow-up care provided. Optimal care includes home nursing visits through the\\nfourth postpartum day.\\nDisadvantages of early discharge are the increased risks of rehospitalization of some neonates for\\nhyperbilirubinemia and neonatal infection (eg, from group B streptococci).\\nActivities & Rest\\nThe policy of early ambulation after delivery benefits the patient. Early ambulation provides a sense\\nof well-being, hastens involution of the uterus, improves uterine drainage, and lessens the incidence of\\npostpartum thromboembolic event. If the delivery has been uncomplicated, the patient may be out of\\nbed as soon as tolerated. Early ambulation does not mean immediate return to normal activity or work.\\nCommonly mothers complain of lethargy and fatigue. Therefore, rest is essential after delivery, and\\nthe demands on the mother should be limited to allow for adequate relaxation and adjustment to her\\nnew responsibilities. It is helpful to set aside a few hours each day for rest periods. Many mothers do\\nnot sleep well for several nights after delivery, and it is surprising how much of the day is occupied\\nwith the care of the newborn.\\nIn uncomplicated deliveries, more vigorous activity, climbing stairs, lifting of heavy objects, riding\\nin or driving a car, and performing muscle toning exercises may be resumed without delay.

Exercise postpartum does not compromise lactation or neonatal weight\\ngain. It may be beneficial in decreasing anxiety levels and decreasing the incidence of postpartum\\ndepression.\\nDiet\\nA regular diet is permissible as soon as the patient wishes in the absence of complication. Protein-rich\\nfoods, fruits, vegetables, milk products, and a high fluid intake are recommended, especially for\\nnursing mothers. It is estimated that women will need approximately 500 kcal per day more than the\\nrecommended level for nonpregnant and nonlactating women. It may be advisable to continue the\\ndaily vitamin–mineral supplement during the early puerperium. Lactating women are advised to\\nmaintain calcium intake of 1000 mg per day and should be encouraged to drink plenty of fluids to\\nmaintain adequate hydration. After caesarean section, there is no evidence supporting compromised\\nsafety or comfort from the introduction of solid foods early and allowing the patient to decide when to\\neat postoperatively. In fact, early feeding as tolerated by the patient has been shown to be safe, to\\nenhance patient satisfaction, to minimize hospital stay, and to facilitate a more rapid return to normal\\ndiet and bowel function.\\nCare of the Bladder\\nMost women empty the bladder during labor or have been catheterized at delivery. Even so, serious\\nbladder distention may develop within 12 hours. A prolonged second stage of labor or operative\\ndelivery may traumatize the base of the bladder and interfere with normal voiding and is significantly\\nassociated with protracted urinary retention beyond the third postpartum day. In some cases,\\noverdistention of the bladder may be related to pain or regional anesthesia. Mechanical bladder outlet\\nobstruction may develop secondary to edema or local hematoma, functional obstruction may be\\nsecondary to pain, and detrusor underactivity may be due to bladder overdistention during labor. The\\nmarked polyuria noted for the first few days postpartum causes the bladder to fill in a relatively short\\ntime. Hence obstetric patients require catheterization more frequently than most surgical patients. The\\npatient should be catheterized every 6 hours after delivery if she is unable to void or empty her\\nbladder completely. Intermittent catheterization is preferable to an indwelling catheter because the\\nincidence of urinary tract infection is lower. However, if the bladder fills to more than 1000 mL, 1–2\\ndays of decompression by a retention catheter usually is required to establish voiding without\\nsignificant residual urine. Postpartum voiding dysfunction is common but usually self-limited and\\nspontaneously resolves within 3 days.\\nThe incidence of true asymptomatic bacteriuria is approximately 5% in the early puerperium.\\nPostpartum patients with a history of previous urinary tract infection, conduction anesthesia, and\\ncatheterization during delivery and operative delivery should have a bacterial culture of a midstream\\nurine specimen. In cases of confirmed bacteriuria, antibiotic treatment should be given; otherwise,\\nbacteriuria will persist in nearly 30% of patients. Three days of therapy is sufficient and avoids\\nprolonged antibiotic exposure to the lactating mother.\\nBowel Function\\nPregnancy itself is associated with increased gastric emptying, but gastrointestinal motility is\\ncommonly delayed after labor and delivery. The mild ileus that follows delivery, together with\\nperineal discomfort and postpartum fluid loss by other routes, predisposes to constipation during the\\npuerperium.

Sitz or tub baths probably are safe if\\nperformed in a clean environment. Most patients prefer showers to tub baths because of the profuse\\nflow of lochia immediately postpartum; however, sitz baths may be beneficial for perineal pain relief.\\nVaginal douching is contraindicated in the early puerperium. Tampons may be used whenever the\\npatient is comfortable.\\nCare of the Perineum\\nPostpartum perineal care, even in the patient with an uncomplicated and satisfactorily repaired\\nepisiotomy or laceration, usually requires no more than routine cleansing with a bath or shower and\\nanalgesia.\\nImmediately after delivery, cold compresses (usually ice) applied to the perineum decrease\\ntraumatic edema and discomfort. The perineal area should be gently cleansed with plain soap at least\\nonce or twice per day and after voiding or defecation. If the perineum is kept clean, healing should\\noccur rapidly. Cold or iced sitz baths, rather than hot sitz baths, may provide additional perineal pain\\nrelief for some patients. The patient should be put in a lukewarm tub to which ice cubes are added for\\n20–30 minutes. The cold promotes pain relief by decreasing the excitability of nerve endings and\\nslowing nerve conduction, and by local vasoconstriction, which reduces edema, inhibits hematoma\\nformation, and decreases muscle irritability and spasm. Episiotomy pain is easily controlled with\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, which appear to be superior to acetaminophen or\\npropoxyphene.\\nAn episiotomy or repaired lacerations should be inspected daily. A patient with mediolateral\\nepisiotomy, a third- or fourth-degree laceration or extension, or extensive bruising or edema may\\nexperience severe perineal pain. In the case of persistent or unusual pain, a vaginal and/or rectal\\nexamination should be performed to identify a hematoma, perineal infection, or potentially fatal\\nconditions, such as angioedema, necrotizing fasciitis, or perineal cellulitis. Episiotomy wounds rarely\\nbecome infected, which is remarkable considering the difficulty of preventing contamination of the\\nperineal area. In the event of infection, local heat and irrigation should cause the infection to subside.\\nAppropriate antibiotics may be indicated if an immediate response to these measures is not observed.\\nIn rare instances, the wound should be opened widely and sutures removed for adequate drainage.\\nUterotonic Agents'),\n",

A regular pattern of behavior occurs in the human\\nmother immediately after birth of the infant. Touching, holding, and grooming of the infant under\\nnormal conditions rapidly strengthen maternal ties of affection. However, not all mothers react in this\\nway, and some may even feel detached from the new baby. These reactions range from the common,\\nphysiologic, relatively mild, and transient “maternity blues,” which affect some 50–70% of\\npostpartum women, to more severe reactions including depression and rare puerperal psychosis.\\nPostpartum blues or maternity blues occur in up to 70% of postpartum women and appear to be a\\nnormal psychologic adjustment or response.

These transient\\nsymptoms usually occur within the first few days after delivery and cease by postpartum day 10,\\nalthough bouts of weeping may occur for weeks after delivery. The blues are self-limiting, but the\\ndistress can be diminished by physical comfort and reassurance. Evidence suggests that rooming-in\\nduring the hospital stay reduces maternal anxiety and results in more successful breastfeeding.\\nPrematurity or illness of the newborn delays early intimate maternal–infant contact and may have\\nan adverse effect on the rapid and complete development of normal mothering responses. Stressful\\nfactors during the puerperium (eg, marital infidelity or loss of friends as a result of the necessary\\nconfinement and preoccupation with the new baby) may leave the mother feeling unsupported and\\nmay interfere with the formation of a maternal bond with the infant.\\nWhen a baby dies or is born with a congenital defect, the obstetrician should inform the mother and\\nfather about the problem together, if possible.

A discussion of\\nthe normal fluctuations of sexual interest during the puerperium is appropriate, as are suggestions for\\nnoncoital sexual options that enhance the expression of mutual pleasure and affection. The importance\\nof sleep and rest and of the partner’s emotional and physical support is emphasized. If milk ejection\\nduring sexual relations is a concern, nursing the baby before sexual intimacy can help. Sexual\\nrelations can generally be resumed by the third week postpartum, if desired. A water-soluble lubricant\\nor vaginal estrogen cream is especially helpful in lactating amenorrheic mothers in whom vaginal\\natrophy occurs, usually because of low circulating estrogen levels. Patients should be informed that at\\nleast 50% of women engaging in sexual intercourse by 6 weeks will experience dyspareunia, which\\nmay persist up to 1 year. Dyspareunia also occurs in women with caesarean sections and in women\\nusing oral contraceptives who are not breastfeeding.\\nPostpartum Immunization\\nA. Prevention of Rh Isoimmunization\\nThe postpartum injection of Rh\\no\\n (D) immunoglobulin\\n*\\n has been shown to prevent sensitization in the\\nRh-negative woman who has had fetal-to-maternal transfusion of Rh-positive fetal red cells. The risk\\nof maternal sensitization rises with the volume of fetal transplacental hemorrhage. The usual amount\\nof fetal blood that enters the maternal circulation is <0.5 mL. The usual dose of 300 μg of Rh\\no\\n (D)\\nimmunoglobulin is in excess of the dose generally required. Three hundred grams will neutralize\\napproximately 30 mL of whole fetal blood (or 15 mL of Rh+ fetal red blood cells). If neonatal anemia\\nor other clinical symptoms suggest the occurrence of a large transplacental hemorrhage, the amount of\\nfetal blood in the maternal circulation can be estimated by the Kleihauer-Betke smear and the amounts\\nof Rh\\no\\n (D) immunoglobulin to be administered adjusted accordingly.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Rh\\no\\n (D) immunoglobulin is administered after abortion without qualifications or after delivery to\\nwomen who meet all of the following criteria: (1) The mother must be Rh\\no\\n (D)-negative without Rh\\nantibodies, (2) the baby must be Rh (D)+ or Rh (D)-/Du-positive, and (3) the cord blood must be\\nCoombs-negative. If these criteria are met, a 1:1000 dilution of Rh\\no\\n (D) immunoglobulin is cross-\\nmatched to the mother’s red cells to ensure compatibility, and 1 mL (300 μg) is given intramuscularly\\nto the mother within 72 hours after delivery. If the 72-hour interval has been exceeded, it is advisable\\nto give the immunoglobulin rather than withhold it because it may still protect against sensitization\\n14–28 days after delivery, and the time required to mount a response varies among cases. The 72-hour\\ntime limit for administration of Rh immunoglobulin was a study limitation in a study in which\\npatients in prison were allowed to be visited only every 3 days; thus the use of Rh immunoglobulin\\npast the 3-day interval was never studied. Rh\\no\\n (D) immunoglobulin should also be given after delivery\\nor abortion when serologic tests of maternal sensitization to the Rh factor are questionable.\\nThe average risk of maternal sensitization after abortion is approximately half the risk incurred by\\nfull-term pregnancy and delivery; the latter has been estimated at 11%. Women with pregnancy losses\\nup to 12 weeks may receive a smaller dose of Rh immunoglobulin, as the 50-μg dose is sufficient to\\nprotect against 2.5 mL of Rh-positive fetal red blood cells. Even though mothers have received Rh\\no\\n(D) immunoglobulin, they should be screened with each subsequent pregnancy because postpartum\\nprophylaxis failures still exist. Failures are related to inadequate Rh\\no\\n (D) immunoglobulin\\nadministration postpartum, an undetected very low titer in the previous pregnancy, and inexcusable\\noversights. Routine use of postpartum screening protocols to identify excess fetomaternal hemorrhage\\nand strict adherence to recommended protocols for the management of unsensitized Rh-negative\\nwomen will prevent most of these postpartum sensitizations.\\nB. Rubella Vaccination\\nA significant number of women of childbearing age estimated at 10–20% have never been immunized\\nor exposed to rubella infection. The appropriate test for assessing rubella immunity is the\\nimmunoglobulin G serology. Women who are susceptible to rubella can be vaccinated safely and\\neffectively with a live attenuated rubella virus vaccine (RA 27/3 strain) during the immediate\\npuerperium. It is more immunogenic than earlier forms of the vaccine and is available in monovalent,\\nbivalent (measles-rubella [MR]), and trivalent (measles-mumps-rubella [MMR]) forms.\\nSeroconversion occurs in approximately 95% of women vaccinated postpartum. There is no\\ncontraindication to giving MMR vaccination while breastfeeding, and it is not associated with viral\\ntransmission to newborns. Women who receive rubella vaccinations are not contagious and cannot\\ntransmit infection to other susceptible children or adults. In addition, the serologic response against\\nrubella is satisfactory when given concomitantly with other immunoglobulins such as Rh-\\nimmunoglobulin. Vaccinated patients should be informed that transient side effects can result from\\nrubella vaccination. Mild symptoms such as low-grade fever and malaise may occur in fewer than\\n25% of patients and arthralgias and rash in fewer than 10%; rarely, overt arthritis may develop.\\nAmong adult women there is a 10–15% incidence of acute polyarthritis after immunization. In 2001,\\nthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed the safe pregnancy interval after\\nreceiving the rubella vaccine from 3 months to 1 month. The receipt of vaccination during the\\npregnancy is not an indication for termination. The maximum theoretical risk of congenital rubella\\nresulting from vaccination during early pregnancy is 1–2%.\\nC. Postpartum Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Pertussis) Vaccination\\nWith the incidence of pertussis growing among adults and adolescents in the United States, there is a'),\n",

Infants do\\nnot have full immunity against pertussis until they have received at least 3 doses of pertussis-\\ncontaining vaccine, making infants younger than 6 months the most susceptible. Pertussis is\\npreventable through vaccination; however, immunity from childhood pertussis vaccines wanes after\\n5–10 years, making adolescent and adult populations again susceptible to pertussis. Infants under 12\\nmonths of age comprised 19% of cases and 92% of pertussis deaths in the United States from 2000–\\n2004. Of those with pertussis, 63% required hospitalization, and 13% were diagnosed with pneumonia.\\nThe use of Tdap vaccine in the postpartum woman can provide protection to infants.\\nThe Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine postpartum Tdap\\nfor those pregnant women who previously have not received a dose of Tdap (including women who are\\nbreastfeeding) before discharge from the hospital or birthing center. If Tdap cannot be administered\\nbefore discharge, it should be given as soon as it is feasible. The dose of Tdap replaces the next\\ndecennial dose of Td. Providers who choose to administer Tdap to pregnant women should discuss the\\nlack of safety data with the pregnant patient.\\nD. Postpartum Influenza Vaccination\\nThe ACIP recommends universal flu vaccination in the United States. Pregnant women are\\ncharacterized by the CDC as a high-risk population because having the flu would place these women\\nand their fetuses at increased risk of complications. The “flu shot” should thus be offered to these\\nwomen as soon as flu season begins in September. This intramuscular form of the vaccine contains\\nkilled inactivated virus and is safe in pregnancy. The nasal-spray flu vaccine is not a safe option for\\npregnant women because it contains \\nlive albeit weakened flu viruses. If a pregnant woman does not\\nreceive the flu shot during pregnancy, then she should be given the vaccine in the immediate\\npostpartum period. The ACIP strongly recommends that household contacts and caregivers of children\\nyounger than 6 months receive the flu shot, because children this young are at high risk for\\ncomplications from the flu and are too young to be vaccinated themselves. Women in this postpartum\\nperiod are eligible for either the flu shot or nasal-spray vaccine.\\nContraception & Sterilization\\nThe immediate puerperium has long been recognized as a convenient time for the discussion of family\\nplanning, although these discussions ideally should begin during prenatal care. Pregnancy prevention\\nand birth control decisions should be made before discharge with a qualified nurse, physician, or\\nphysician’s assistant or with the aid of educational tools. Anovulatory infertility lasts approximately 5\\nweeks in nonlactating women and >8 weeks in fully lactating women. The lactational pregnancy rate\\nis approximately 1–2% at 1 year postpartum.\\nTubal sterilization is the most common method of contraception used in the United States. It is the\\nprocedure of choice for women desiring permanent sterilization. It can be performed easily at the time\\nof caesarean section or within 48 hours postpartum after vaginal delivery in uncomplicated patients\\nwithout prolonging hospitalization or significantly increasing morbidity. Sterilization may not be\\nadvisable in women younger than 30 years, those of low parity, or when the neonatal outcome is in\\ndoubt and survival of the infant is not assured. Postponing tubal sterilization 6–8 weeks postpartum is\\ndesirable for many couples, as it allows time to ensure that the infant is healthy, to fully understand\\nthe implications of permanent sterilization, and, according to the US Collaborative Review on\\nSterilization, to decrease feelings of guilt and regret. It also allows for different surgical approaches to\\nbe discussed, including the hysteroscopic Essure device (Conceptus, Mountain View, CA), which has\\nthe benefit of avoiding abdominal incisions.'),\n",

Patient\\nambivalence at the last minute is not unusual, in which case it is advisable to defer the procedure until\\nafter the puerperium. The 10-year failure rate of postpartum sterilization ranges from 1–3% and varies\\nwith type of procedure performed. The risks of postpartum or interval tubal ligation are infrequent,\\nand deaths from the procedure occur in 2–12 per 100,000 cases. Long-term complications, such as the\\nposttubal syndrome (irregular menses and increased menstrual pain) have been reported in some 10–\\n15% of women; however, well-controlled prospective studies have failed to confirm that these\\nsymptoms occur more frequently with sterilization than in controls.\\nUse of lactational amenorrhea for family planning in exclusively breastfeeding mothers provides\\n98% contraceptive protection for up to 6 months according to some studies; however, concurrent use\\nof progestin-only pill is advisable to increase the contraceptive efficacy. When menses return, natural\\nfamily planning may begin. This method, which has pregnancy rates comparable to those of barrier\\nmethods, uses detection of the periovulatory period by evaluating cervical mucus changes and/or basal\\nbody temperature changes. Patients should be aware that the natural method is not always reliable and\\ncan potentially increase the chance of pregnancy, especially in those women with irregular cycles.\\nUse of spermicides, a condom, or both may be prescribed until the postpartum examination; these\\nmethods carry a failure rate of 1.6–21 per 100 woman-years. Fitting of a diaphragm is not practical\\nuntil involution of the reproductive organs has taken place and may be more difficult in lactating\\nwomen with vaginal dryness. It should always be used in conjunction with a spermicidal lubricant\\ncontaining nonoxynol-9. The failure rate for the diaphragm varies from 2.4–19.6 per 100 woman-\\nyears, with the lowest failure rates (comparable to the intrauterine device [IUD]) occurring in women\\nwho are older, motivated, experienced, or familiar with the technique.\\nCombined hormonal contraception, including the pill, patch, or ring, functions by suppressing\\novulation, increasing cervical mucus viscosity, and lowering the receptivity of the endometrium to\\nimplantation. Oral contraception should be deferred until 6 weeks postpartum because of concerns\\nabout the postpartum hypercoagulable state. Of note, the vaginal ring produces the lowest estrogen\\nlevels of any combined hormonal contraceptive available. The typical use failure rate for combined\\nhormonal contraception is 7–8% due primarily to missed pills or failure to resume therapy after the 7-\\nday pill-free interval. Studies are inconclusive regarding estrogen’s effect on milk letdown, and\\nseveral studies have shown no deleterious effect of oral contraceptive pills on the breastfed infant.\\nProgestin-only oral contraceptive (norethindrone 0.35 mg/d) has proven to be a safe option that does\\nnot suppress lactation and in fact may actually enhance lactation. Its contraceptive efficacy is\\nmaximum with exclusive breastfeeding, and additional or alternative contraceptive methods are\\nadvisable when breastfeeding frequency is decreased. The use of a long-acting progestin such as depot\\nmedroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera; Pfizer, New York, NY), 150 mg administered\\nintramuscularly or 104 mg administered subcutaneously every 3 months, provides effective\\ncontraception (>99% contraceptive efficacy) for the lactating woman without increasing the risk of\\nmaternal thromboembolism or decreasing milk yield. However, concerns related to prolonged\\namenorrhea, prolonged return to fertility, the inconvenience of unscheduled bleeding, weight gain,\\nskin changes, and reversible bone density reduction and lipid metabolism changes are potential\\nreasons for discontinuation. On the other hand, the level of progestin in depot medroxyprogesterone\\nacetate \\nraises the seizure threshold and is the contraceptive of choice for women with seizure\\ndisorders.\\nLevonorgestrel implants placed after establishment of lactation (immediately postpartum or by 6\\nweeks) provide acceptable contraception with no effect on lactation or infant growth.

Ideally, an\\nIUD should be placed at the first postpartum visit; however, it may be placed as early as immediately\\npostpartum. In this latter case, the incidence of expulsion appears higher than with interval insertion.\\nThe main side effects include <1% risk of pelvic infection in the first 2 weeks after insertion, uterine\\nperforation (<1%), expulsion (<3%), and abnormal uterine bleeding. The risk of ectopic pregnancy is\\nlower among women with the Mirena or ParaGard compared with women using no contraception. The\\nrisk of uterine perforation during IUD insertion is higher in lactating women, probably because of the\\naccelerated rate of uterine involution.

The degree of\\nuterine involution and tenderness should be noted. The calves and thighs should be palpated to rule out\\nthrombophlebitis. The characteristics of the lochia are important and should be observed. The\\nepisiotomy wound should be inspected to see whether it is healing satisfactorily. A blood sample\\nshould be obtained for hematocrit or hemoglobin determination. Unless the patient has an unusual\\npelvic complaint, there is little need to perform a vaginal examination. The obstetrician should be\\ncertain that the patient is voiding normally, has normal bowel function, and is physically able to\\nassume her new responsibilities at home.\\nThe patient will require some advice on what she is allowed to do when she arrives home. Hygiene\\nis essentially the same as practiced in the hospital, with a premium on cleanliness. Upon discharge\\nfrom the hospital, the patient should be instructed to rest for at least 2 hours during the day, and her\\nusual household activities should be curtailed. Activities, exercise, and return to work will be\\nindividualized. Accepted disability after delivery is 6 weeks. Various forms of social support are\\ncritical for mothers, especially those employed outside the home: available, high-quality day care;\\nparental leave for both mothers and fathers; and support provided by the workplace such as flexible\\nhours, the opportunity to breastfeed, on-site day care, and care for sick children. The patient who has\\nhad frequent prenatal visits to her obstetrician may feel cut off from the doctor during the interval\\nbetween discharge and the first postpartum visit. She will feel reassured in this period if she receives\\nthoughtful advice on what she is allowed to do and what she can expect when she arrives home.

Their role is to provide nourishment for\\nthe newborn and to transfer antibodies from mother to infant.\\nDuring the first half of pregnancy, proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells, formation of new ducts,\\nand development of lobular architecture occur. Later in pregnancy, proliferation declines, and the\\nepithelium differentiates for secretory activity. At the end of gestation, each breast will have gained\\napproximately 400 g. Factors contributing to increase in mammary size include hypertrophy of blood\\nvessels, myoepithelial cells, and connective tissue; deposition of fat; and retention of water and\\nelectrolytes. Blood flow is almost double that of the nonpregnant state.\\nLactation depends on a delicate balance of several hormones. An intact hypothalamic–pituitary axis\\nis essential to the initiation and maintenance of lactation. Lactation can be divided into 3 stages: (1)\\nmammogenesis, or mammary growth and development; (2) lactogenesis, or initiation of milk\\nsecretion; and (3) galactopoiesis, or maintenance of established milk secretion (\\nTable 10–2\\n). \\nEstrogen\\nis responsible for the growth of ductal tissue and alveolar budding, whereas progesterone is required\\nfor optimal maturation of the alveolar glands. Glandular stem cells undergo differentiation into\\nsecretory and myoepithelial cells under the influence of prolactin, growth hormone, insulin, cortisol,\\nand an epithelial growth factor. Although alveolar secretory cells actively synthesize milk fat and\\nproteins from midpregnancy onward, only small amounts are released into the lumen. However,\\nlactation is possible if pregnancy is interrupted during the second trimester.\\nTable 10–2\\n. Multihormonal interaction in mammary growth and lactation.\\nProlactin is a necessary hormone for milk production, but lactogenesis also requires a low-estrogen\\nenvironment. Although prolactin levels continue to rise as pregnancy advances, placental sex steroids\\nblock prolactin-induced secretory activity of the glandular epithelium. It appears that sex steroids and\\nprolactin are synergistic in mammogenesis but antagonistic in galactopoiesis. Therefore, lactation is\\nnot initiated until plasma estrogens, progesterone, and human placental lactogen levels fall after\\ndelivery. Progesterone inhibits the biosynthesis of lactose and α-lactalbumin; estrogens directly\\nantagonize the lactogenic effect of prolactin on the mammary gland by inhibiting α-lactalbumin\\nproduction. Human placental lactogen may also exert a prolactin-antagonist effect through\\ncompetitive binding to alveolar prolactin receptors.\\nThe maintenance of established milk secretion requires periodic suckling and the actual emptying\\nof ducts and alveoli. Growth hormone, cortisol, thyroxine, and insulin exert a permissive effect.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Prolactin is required for galactopoiesis, but high basal levels are not mandatory, because prolactin\\nconcentrations in the nursing mother decline gradually during the late puerperium and approach that\\nof the non-pregnant state. However, if a woman does not breastfeed her baby, her serum prolactin\\nconcentration will return to nonpregnant values within 2–3 weeks. If the mother suckles twins\\nsimultaneously, the prolactin response is about double that when 1 baby is fed at a time, illustrating an\\napparent synergism between the number of nipples stimulated and the frequency of suckling. The\\nmechanism by which suckling stimulates prolactin release probably involves the inhibition of\\ndopamine, which is thought to be the hypothalamic prolactin-inhibiting factor.\\nNipple stimulation by suckling or other physical stimuli evokes a reflex release of oxytocin from\\nthe neurohypophysis. Because retrograde blood flow can be demonstrated within the pituitary stalk,\\noxytocin may reach the adenohypophysis in very high concentrations and affect pituitary release of\\nprolactin independently of any effect on dopamine. The release of oxytocin is mediated by afferent\\nfibers of the fourth to sixth intercostal nerves via the dorsal roots of the spinal cord to the midbrain.\\nThe paraventricular and supraoptic neurons of the hypothalamus make up the final afferent\\npathway of the milk ejection reflex. The central nervous system can modulate the release of oxytocin\\nby either stimulating or inhibiting the hypothalamus to increase or decrease prolactin-inhibiting factor\\n(dopamine) and thus the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Thus positive senses related\\nto nursing and crying of infant and positive attitudes in pregnancy and toward breastfeeding can\\nimprove milk yield and the ultimate success of breastfeeding. Likewise, the expectation of nursing is\\nsufficient to release oxytocin before milk letdown but is not effective in releasing prolactin in the\\nabsence of suckling. Contrarily, negative stimuli, such as pain, stress, fear, anxiety, insecurity, or\\nnegative attitudes, may inhibit the letdown reflex. Oxytocin levels may rise during orgasm, and sexual\\nstimuli may trigger milk ejection.\\nSynthesis of Human Milk\\nProlactin ultimately promotes milk production by inducing the synthesis of mRNAs for the production\\nof milk enzymes and milk proteins at the membrane of mammary epithelial cells (alveolar cells).\\nMilk synthesis and secretion are then initiated via four major transcellular and paracellular pathways.\\nThe substrates for milk production are primarily derived from the maternal gut or produced in the\\nmaternal liver. The availability of these substrates is aided by a 20–40% increased blood flow to the\\nmammary gland, gastrointestinal tract, and liver, as well as increased cardiac output during\\nbreastfeeding. The principal carbohydrate in human milk is lactose. Glucose metabolism is a key\\nfunction in human milk production, because lactose is derived from glucose and galactose; the latter\\noriginates from glucose-6-phosphate. A specific protein, α-lactalbumin, catalyzes lactose synthesis.\\nThis rate-limiting enzyme is inhibited by gonadal hormones during pregnancy. Prolactin and insulin,\\nwhich enhance the uptake of glucose by mammary cells, also stimulate the \\nformation of triglycerides.\\nFat synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum. Most proteins are synthesized de novo in the\\nsecretory cells from essential and nonessential plasma amino acids. The formation of milk protein and\\nmammary enzymes is induced by prolactin and enhanced by cortisol and insulin.\\nMature human milk contains 7% carbohydrate as lactose, 3–5% fat, 0.9% protein, and 0.2%\\nmineral constituents expressed as ash. Its energy content is 60–75 kcal/dL. Approximately 25% of the\\ntotal nitrogen of human milk represents nonprotein compounds (eg, urea, uric acid, creatinine, and\\nfree amino acids). The principal proteins of human milk are casein, α-lactalbumin, lactoferrin,\\nimmunoglobulin (Ig) A, lysozyme, and albumin. Milk also contains a variety of enzymes that may\\ncontribute to the infant’s digestion of breast milk (eg, amylase, catalase, peroxidase, lipase, xanthine\\noxidase, and alkaline and acid phosphatase). The fatty acid composition of human milk is rich in'),\n",

The major ions and mineral constituents of\\nhuman milk are Na\\n+\\n, K\\n+\\n, Ca\\n2+\\n, Mg\\n2+\\n, Cl\\n−\\n, phosphorus, sulfate, and citrate. Calcium concentrations\\nvary from 25–35 mg/dL and phosphorus concentrations from 13–16 mg/dL. Iron, copper, zinc, and\\ntrace metal contents vary considerably. All the vitamins except vitamin K are found in human milk in\\nnutritionally adequate amounts. The composition of breast milk is not greatly affected by race, age,\\nparity, normal diet variations, moderate postpartum dieting, weight loss, or aerobic exercise. Volume\\nand caloric density may be reduced in extreme scenarios, such as developing countries where\\nstarvation or daily caloric intake is <1600 kcal/d. In addition, milk composition does not differ\\nbetween the 2 breasts unless 1 breast is infected. However, the volume and concentration of\\nconstituents varies during the day. The volume per feed increases in the late afternoon and evening.\\nNitrogen peaks in the late afternoon. Fat concentrations peak in the morning and are lowest at night.\\nLactose levels remain fairly constant.\\nColostrum,\\n the premilk secretion, is a yellowish alkaline secretion that may be present in the last\\nmonths of pregnancy and for the first 2–3 days after delivery. It has a higher specific gravity (1.040–\\n1.060); a higher protein, vitamin A, immunoglobulin, and sodium and chloride content; and a lower\\ncarbohydrate, potassium, and fat content than mature breast milk. Colostrum has a normal laxative\\naction and is an ideal natural starter food.\\nIons and water pass the membrane of the alveolar cell in both directions. Human milk differs from\\nthe milk of many other species by having a lower concentration of monovalent ions and a higher\\nconcentration of lactose. The aqueous phase of milk is isosmotic with plasma; thus the higher the\\nlactose, the lower the ion concentration. The ratio of potassium/sodium is 3:1 in both milk and\\nmammary intracellular fluid. Because milk contains approximately 87% water and lactose is the\\nmajor osmotically active solute, it follows that milk yield is largely determined by lactose production.\\nImmunologic Significance of Human Milk\\nThe neonate’s secretory immune system and cellular responses are immature. In particular, the IgM\\nand IgA responses are poor, and cellular immunity is impaired for several months. Maternal transfer\\nof immunoglobulins through breast milk provides support for the infant’s developing immune system\\nand thereby enhances neonatal defense against infection. All classes of immunoglobulins are found in\\nmilk, but IgA constitutes 90% of immunoglobulins in human colostrum and milk. The output of\\nimmunoglobulins by the breast is maximal in the first week of life and declines thereafter as the\\nproduction of milk-specific proteins increases. Lacteal antibodies against enteric bacteria and their\\nantigenic products are largely of the IgA class. IgG and IgA lacteal antibodies provide short-term\\nsystemic and long-term enteric humoral immunity to the breastfed neonate. IgA antipoliomyelitis\\nvirus activity present in breastfed infants indicates that at least some transfer of milk antibodies into\\nserum does occur. However, maternal lacteal antibodies are absorbed systemically by human infants\\nfor only a very short time after birth. Long-term protection against pathogenic enteric bacteria is\\nprovided by the absorption of lacteal IgA to the intestinal mucosa. In addition to providing passive\\nimmunity, there is evidence that lacteal immunoglobulins can modulate the immunocompetence of\\nthe neonate, but the exact mechanisms have not been described. For instance, the secretion of IgA into\\nthe saliva of breastfed infants is enhanced in comparison with bottle-fed controls.\\nBreast milk is highly anti-infective, containing more than 4000 cells/mm\\n3\\n, the majority of which\\nare leukocytes. The total cell count is even higher in colostrum. In human milk, the leukocytes are\\npredominantly mononuclear cells and macrophages. Both T and B lymphocytes are present. During\\nmaternal infection, antigen-specific lymphocytes can migrate to the breast mucosa or produce\\nimmunoglobulins, both of which are key in the fight against infection. Fully functional'),\n",

Polymeric secretory IgA is easily\\ntransported across the mucous membrane of the breast, blocking the mucosal receptors of infectious\\nagents.\\nElements in breast milk other than immunoglobulins and cells have prophylactic value against\\ninfections. The marked difference between the intestinal flora of breastfed and bottle-fed infants is\\ndue to a dialyzable nitrogen-containing carbohydrate (bifidus factor) that supports the growth of\\nLactobacillus bifidus\\n in breastfed infants. The stool of bottle-fed infants is more alkaline and contains\\npredominantly coliform organisms and \\nBacteroides\\n spp. \\nL bifidus\\n inhibits the growth of \\nShigella\\n spp,\\nEscherichia coli\\n, and yeast. Human milk also contains a nonspecific antimicrobial factor, lysozyme (a\\nthermostable, acid-stable enzyme that cleaves \\nthe peptidoglycans of bacteria), and a “resistance\\nfactor,” which protect the infant against staphylococcal infection. Lactoferrin, an iron chelator, exerts\\na strong bacteriostatic effect on staphylococci and \\nE coli\\n by depriving the organisms of iron. Both C3\\nand C4 components of complement and antitoxins for neutralizing \\nVibrio cholerae\\n are found in human\\nmilk.

Finally, interferon in milk may provide yet another nonspecific anti-\\ninfection factor.\\nHuman milk may also have prophylactic value in childhood food allergies. During the neonatal\\nperiod, permeability of the small intestine to macromolecules is increased. Secretory IgA in colostrum\\nand breast milk reduces the absorption of foreign macromolecules until the endogenous IgA secretory\\ncapacity of the newborn intestinal lamina propria and lymph nodes develops at 2–3 months of age.\\nProtein of cow’s milk can be highly allergenic in the infant predisposed by heredity. The introduction\\nof cow’s milk–free formulas has considerably reduced the incidence of milk allergy. Thus\\ncomparative studies on the incidence of allergy, bacterial and viral infections, severe diarrhea,\\nnecrotizing enterocolitis, tuberculosis, and neonatal meningitis in breastfed and bottle-fed infants\\nsupport the concept that breast milk fulfills a protective function.\\nAdvantages & Disadvantages of Breastfeeding\\nA. For the Mother\\n1. Advantages\\n—Breastfeeding is convenient, economical, and emotionally satisfying to most women.\\nIt helps to contract the uterus and accelerates the process of uterine involution in the postpartum\\nperiod, including decreased maternal blood loss. It promotes mother–infant bonding and self-\\nconfidence. Maternal gastrointestinal motility and absorption are enhanced. Ovulatory cycles are\\ndelayed with exclusive breastfeeding. According to epidemiologic studies, breastfeeding may help to\\nprotect against premenopausal cancer and ovarian cancer. American College of Obstetrics and\\nGynecologists recommends that exclusive breastfeeding be continued until the infant is at least 6\\nmonths old.\\n2. Disadvantages\\n—Regular nursing restricts activities and may be perceived by some mothers as an\\ninconvenience. Twins can be nursed successfully, but few women are prepared for the first weeks of\\nalmost continual feeding. Caesarean section may necessitate modifications of early breastfeeding\\nroutines. Difficulties such as nipple tenderness and mastitis may develop. Compared with nonlactating\\nwomen, breastfeeding women have a significant decrease (mean 6.5%) in bone mineral content at 6\\nmonths postpartum, but there is “catch-up” remineralization after weaning.\\nThere are few absolute contraindications to breastfeeding (see Disadvantages and Contraindications\\nfor the Infant).'),\n",

Advantages\\n—Breast milk is digestible, of ideal composition, available at the right temperature and\\nthe right time, and free of bacterial contamination. Infants of breastfed mothers have a decreased\\nincidence of all of the following: diarrhea, lower respiratory tract infection, otitis media, pneumonia,\\nurinary tract infections, necrotizing enterocolitis, invasive bacterial infection, and sudden infant death.\\nBreastfed infants may have a decreased risk of developing insulin-dependent diabetes, Crohn’s\\ndisease, ulcerative colitis, lymphoma, and allergic diseases later in life. Breastfed infants are less\\nlikely to become obese later in life. Suckling promotes infant–mother bonding. Cognitive\\ndevelopment and intelligence may be improved.\\n2. Disadvantages and Contraindications\\n—Absolute contraindications to breastfeeding include the\\nuse of street drugs or excess alcohol; human T-cell leukemia virus type 1; breast cancer; active herpes\\nsimplex infection of the breast; active pulmonary tuberculosis or human T-cell lymphotropic virus\\ntype I or II positive in the mother; galactosemia in the infant; and maternal intake of cancer\\nchemotherapeutic agents, recent diagnostic or therapeutic radioactive isotopes, or recent exposure to\\nradioactive materials. Specific precautions for individual medications should be reviewed when\\nprescribing drugs to lactating women. HIV infection in the United States is also a contraindication to\\nbreastfeeding because it has been recognized as a mode of HIV transmission. Breastfeeding might\\npose an additional risk of vertical transmission (approximately 15%) above that present from the\\nantepartum and intrapartum periods. The risk of HIV transmission through breast milk is substantially\\nhigher among women who become infected during the postpartum lactation period. Most mothers in\\ndeveloped countries who know of their seropositivity choose not to breastfeed; in underdeveloped\\ncountries where lactation is critical to infant survival, breastfeeding is recommended even among\\nHIV-infected mothers.\\nBreastfeeding is not contraindicated for mothers who are hepatitis B surface antigen positive, or\\nmothers who are infected with hepatitis C virus (positive hepatitis C virus antibody or virus-RNA–\\npositive blood). The presence of fever or seropositivity for chronic exposure to cytomegalovirus\\n(CMV) are also not contraindications to breastfeeding. Caution should be exercised in low-birth-\\nweight babies where potential risk of transmission must be balanced against nutritional benefit.\\nFreezing and pasteurization can decrease the CMV viral load in the mother’s milk.\\nThe milk of a nursing mother with cystic fibrosis is high in sodium and places the infant at risk for\\nhypernatremia. A woman with clinically infectious varicella should be isolated from the infant and\\nshould neither breastfeed nor bottle-feed. Once the infant has received varicella zoster immune\\nglobulin and there are no skin lesions on the mother’s breast, \\nshe may provide expressed milk for her\\ninfant. A small number of otherwise healthy breastfed infants develop unconjugated\\nhyperbilirubinemia (sometimes exceeding 20 mg/dL) during the first few weeks of life because of the\\nhigher than normal glucuronyl transferase inhibitory activity of the breast milk. The inhibitor may be\\na pregnanediol, although increased milk lipase activity and free fatty acids are likely the critical\\nfactors.\\nBreastfeeding is not usually possible for weak, ill, or very premature infants or for infants with\\ncleft palate, choanal atresia, or phenylketonuria. It is common practice in many nurseries to feed\\npremature infants human milk collected fresh from their mothers or processed from donors.

Many women with breast implants breastfeed successfully, but reduction\\nmammoplasty involving nipple autotransplantation severs the lactiferous ducts and precludes nursing.\\nThe success rate of breastfeeding decreases approximately 25% and the need to supplement with\\nformula increases 19% in women after augmentation. When nipple sensation is lost as a result of\\nbreast surgery, breastfeeding is not possible. Other postoperative factors, such as breast pain, capsular\\ncontracture, and pressure on the breast from the implant, may compromise a woman’s ability to\\nexclusively breastfeed. Finally, the psychologic concern that breastfeeding may compromise the\\nresults of a cosmetic surgery may interfere with breastfeeding attempts.\\nPrinciples & Techniques of Breastfeeding\\nIn the absence of anatomic or medical complications, the timing of the first feeding and the frequency\\nand duration of subsequent feedings largely determine the outcome of breastfeeding. Infants and\\nmothers who are able to initiate breastfeeding within 1–2 hours of delivery are more successful than\\nthose whose initial interactions are delayed for several hours. Lactation is established most\\nsuccessfully if the baby remains with the mother and she can feed on demand for adequate intervals\\nthroughout the first 24-hour period. The initial feeding should last 5 minutes at each breast in order to\\ncondition the letdown reflex. At first, the frequency of feedings may be very irregular (8–10 times per\\nday), but after 1–2 weeks a fairly regular 4- to 6-hour pattern will emerge.\\nWhen the milk “comes in” abruptly on the third or fourth postpartum day, there is an initial period\\nof discomfort caused by vascular engorgement and edema of the breasts. The baby does not nurse so\\nmuch by developing intermittent negative pressure as by a rhythmic grasping of the areola; the infant\\n“works” the milk into its mouth. Little force is required in nursing because the breast reservoirs can be\\nemptied and refilled without suction. Nursing mothers notice a sensation of drawing and tightening\\nwithin the breast at the beginning of suckling after the initial breast engorgement disappears. They are\\nthus conscious of the milk ejection reflex, which may even cause milk to spurt or run out.\\nSome women expend a great deal of emotion on the subject of breastfeeding, and a few are almost\\noverwhelmed by fear of being unable to care for their babies in this way. If attendants are sympathetic\\nand patient, however, a woman who wants to nurse usually can do so. Attendants must be certain that\\nthe baby “latches” on (actually over) the nipple and the areola so as to feed properly without causing\\npain for the mother.\\nThe baby should nurse at both breasts at each feeding, because overfilling of the breasts is the main\\ndeterrent to the maintenance of milk secretion. Nursing at only 1 breast at each feeding inhibits the\\nreflex that is provoked simultaneously in both breasts. Thus nursing at alternate breasts from 1\\nfeeding to the next may increase discomfort due to engorgement and reduce milk output. It is helpful\\nfor the mother to be taught to empty the breasts after each feeding; a sleepy baby may not have\\naccomplished this. The use of supplementary formula or other food during the first 6–8 weeks of\\nbreastfeeding can interfere with lactation and should be avoided except when absolutely necessary.\\nThe introduction of an artificial nipple, which requires a different sucking mechanism, will weaken\\nthe sucking reflex required for breastfeeding. Some groups, such as the La Leche League, recommend\\nthat other fluids be given by spoon or dropper rather than by bottle.\\nIn preparing to nurse, the mother should (1) wash her hands with soap and water, (2) clean her\\nnipples and breasts with water, and (3) assume a comfortable position, preferably in a rocking or\\nupright chair with the infant and mother chest-to-chest. If the mother is unable to sit up to nurse her\\nbaby because of painful perineal sutures, she may feel more comfortable lying on her side. An'),\n",

A woman with large pendulous breasts may find it difficult to\\nmanage both the breasts and the baby. If the baby lies on a pillow, the mother will have both hands\\nfree to guide the nipple.\\nEach baby nurses differently; however, the following procedure is generally successful:\\n1. Allow the normal newborn to nurse at each breast on demand or approximately every 3–4 hours,\\nfor 5 minutes per breast per feeding the first day. Over the next few days, gradually increase\\nfeeding time to initiate the letdown reflex, but do not exceed 10–15 minutes per breast. Suckling\\nfor longer than 15 minutes may cause maceration and cracking of the nipples and thus lead to\\nmastitis.\\n2. Stimulating the cheek or lateral angle of the baby’s mouth should precipitate a reflex turn to the\\nnipple and opening of the mouth. The infant is brought firmly to the breast, and the nipple and\\nareola are placed into the mouth as far as the nipple–areola line. Slight negative pressure holds the\\nteat in place, and milk is obtained with a peristaltic motion of the tongue. Compressing the\\nperiareolar area and expressing a small amount of colostrum or milk for the baby to taste may\\nstimulate the baby to nurse.\\n3. Try to keep the baby awake by moving or patting, but do not snap its feet, work its jaw, push its\\nhead, or press its cheeks.\\n4. Before removing the infant from the breast, gently open its mouth by lifting the outer border of\\nthe upper lip to break the suction.\\nAfter nursing, gently wipe the nipples with water and dry them.\\nMilk Yield\\nThe prodigious energy requirements for lactation are met by mobilization of elements from maternal\\ntissues and from dietary intake. Physiologic fat stores laid down during pregnancy are mobilized\\nduring lactation, and the return to prepregnancy weight and figure is promoted. A variety of studies\\nsuggest that a lactating woman should increase her normal daily food intake by 500 kcal/d, but intakes\\nof 2000–2300 calories are sufficient for lactating women. The recommended daily dietary increases\\nfor lactation are 20 g of protein; a 20% increase in all vitamins and minerals except folic acid, which\\nshould be increased by 50%; and a 33% increase in calcium, phosphorus, and magnesium. There is no\\nevidence that increasing fluid intake will increase milk volume. Fluid restriction also has little effect\\nbecause urine output will diminish in preference to milk output.\\nWith nursing, average milk production on the second postpartum day is approximately 120 mL.\\nThe amount increases to about 180 mL on the third postpartum day and to as much as 240 mL on the\\nfourth day. In time, milk production reaches approximately 300 mL/d.\\nA good rule of thumb for the calculation of milk production for a given day in the week after\\ndelivery is to multiply the number of the postpartum day by 60. This gives the approximate number of\\nmilliliters of milk secreted in that 24-hour period.\\nIf all goes well, sustained production of milk will be achieved by most patients after 10–14 days. A\\nyield of 120–180 mL per feeding is common by the end of the second week. When free secretion has\\nbeen established, marked increases are possible.\\nEarly diminution of milk production often is due to failure to empty the breasts because of weak\\nefforts by the baby or ineffectual nursing procedures; emotional problems, such as aversion to\\nnursing; or medical complications, such as mastitis, debilitating systemic disease, or Sheehan’s'),\n",

Late diminution of milk production results from too generous complementary feedings of\\nformula, emotional or other illness, and pregnancy.\\nAdequate rest is essential for successful lactation. Sometimes it is difficult to ensure an adequate\\nmilk yield if the mother is working outside the home. If it is not possible to rearrange the nursing\\nschedule to fit the work schedule or vice versa, it may be necessary to empty the breasts manually or\\nby pump. Milk output can be estimated by weighing the infant before and after feeding. If there has\\nbeen a bowel movement during feeding, the baby should be weighed before the diaper is changed.\\nIt may be necessary to substitute bottle-feeding for breastfeeding if the mother’s supply continues\\nto be inadequate (<50% of the infant’s needs) after 3 weeks of effort, if nipple or breast lesions are\\nsevere enough to prevent pumping, or if the mother is either pregnant or severely (physically or\\nmentally) ill. Nourishment from the inadequately lactating breast can be augmented with the Lact-Aid\\nNursing Trainer (Lact-Aid International, Athens, TN), a device that provides a supplemental source of\\nmilk via a plastic capillary tube placed beside the breast and suckled simultaneously with the nipple.\\nDisposable plastic bags serve as reservoirs, and the supplemental milk is warmed by hanging the bag\\nnext to the mother. The Lact-Aide supplementer has also been used to help nurse premature infants\\nand to re-establish lactation after untimely weaning due to illness. The long-term success of\\nbreastfeeding is increased by a structured home support system of postnatal visits by allied health\\npersonnel or experienced volunteers.\\nDisorders of Lactation\\nA. Painful Nipples\\nTenderness of the nipples, a common symptom during the first days of breastfeeding, generally begins\\nwhen the baby starts to suck. As soon as milk begins to flow, nipple sensitivity usually subsides. If\\nmaternal tissues are unusually tender, dry heat may help between feedings. Nipple shields should be\\nused only as a last resort because they interfere with normal sucking. Glass or plastic shields with\\nrubber nursing nipples are preferable to shields made entirely of rubber.\\nNipple fissures cause severe pain and prevent normal letdown of milk. Local infection around the\\nfissure can lead to mastitis. The application of vitamin A and D ointment or hydrous lanolin, which\\ndoes not have to be removed, is often effective. To expedite healing, the following steps are\\nrecommended. Apply dry heat for 20 minutes 4 times per day with a 60-watt bulb held 18 inches away\\nfrom the nipple. Conduct prefeeding manual expression. Begin nursing on the side opposite the fissure\\nwith the other breast exposed to air to allow the initial letdown to occur atraumatically. \\nApply\\nexpressed breast milk to nipples and let it dry in between feedings. If necessary, use a nipple shield\\nwhile nursing, and take ibuprofen or acetaminophen with or without codeine just after nursing. On rare\\noccasions, it may be necessary to stop nursing temporarily on the affected side and to empty the breast\\neither manually or by gentle pumping. Commercially available hydrogel pad is another alternative to\\ntreat sore nipple. It is designed to be worn inside the bra to prevent and soothe painful, cracked, or\\nbleeding nipples and contribute to the healing process. The hydro-gel pad contains a low water/high\\nglycerin content, which provides natural moisture to the area without causing skin maceration. Recent\\nstudies have shown that by retaining the internal natural moisture level of the skin, nipple trauma\\nimproves more quickly.\\nA cause of chronic severe sore nipples without remarkable physical findings is candidal infection.\\nPrompt relief is provided by topical nystatin cream. Thrush or candidal diaper rash or maternal\\ncandidal vaginitis must be treated as well.'),\n",

Engorgement\\nEngorgement of the breasts occurs in the first week postpartum and is due to vascular congestion and\\naccumulation of milk. Vascularity and swelling increase on the second day after delivery, and the\\nareola or breast may become engorged. Prepartum breast massage and around-the-clock demand\\nfeedings help to prevent engorgement in these patients. When the areola is engorged, the nipple is\\noccluded and proper grasping of the areola by the infant is not possible. With moderately severe\\nengorgement, the breasts become firm and warm, and the lobules may be palpable as tender, irregular\\nmasses. Considerable discomfort and often a slight fever can be expected.\\nMild cases may be relieved by acetaminophen or other analgesics, cool compresses, and partial\\nexpression of the milk before nursing. In severe cases, the patient should empty the breasts manually\\nor with an electric pump. Alternative treatments for breast engorgement include acupuncture, cabbage\\nleaves, cold gel packs, pharmacologic treatments, and ultrasound, but none of them have proven to be\\nsuperior for symptom relief.\\nC. Mastitis\\nMastitis occurs most frequently in primiparous nursing patients and usually is caused by coagulase-\\npositive \\nStaphylococcus aureus\\n. High fever should never be ascribed to simple breast engorgement\\nalone. Inflammation of the breast seldom begins before the fifth day postpartum. Most frequently,\\nsymptoms of a painful erythematous lobule in an outer quadrant of the breast are noted during the\\nsecond or third week of the puerperium. Inflammation may occur with weaning when the flow of milk\\nis disrupted, or the nursing mother may acquire the infection during her hospital stay and then\\ntransmit it to the infant. Demonstration of antibody-coated bacteria in the milk indicates the presence\\nof infectious mastitis. Many infants harbor an infection and, in turn, infect the mother’s breast during\\nnursing. Neonatal streptococcal infection should be suspected if mastitis is recurrent or bilateral.\\nInfection may be limited to the subareolar region but more frequently involves an obstructed\\nlactiferous duct and the surrounding breast parenchyma. If cellulitis is not properly treated, a breast\\nabscess may develop. When only mastitis is present, it is best to prevent milk stasis by continuing\\nbreastfeeding or by using a breast pump. Apply local heat, provide a well-fitted bra, and institute\\nappropriate antibiotic treatment. Cephalosporins, methicillin sodium, and dicloxacillin sodium are the\\nantibiotics of choice to combat penicillinase-producing bacteria.\\nThe presence of pitting edema over the inflamed area and any degree of fluctuation suggest abscess\\nformation. It is necessary to incise and open loculated areas and provide wide drainage. Although\\ncorrect breastfeeding techniques and alternation of breast may decrease the formation of nipple crack\\nand mastitis, there is currently insufficient evidence to show effectiveness of any of the interventions,\\nincluding breastfeeding education, pharmacologic treatments, and alternative therapies, regarding the\\noccurrence of mastitis.\\nD. Miscellaneous Complications\\nA galactocele, or milk-retention cyst, is caused by blockage of a milk duct. It usually will resolve with\\nwarm compresses and continuation of breastfeeding. Sometimes the infant will reject one or both\\nbreasts. Strong foods such as beans, cabbage, turnips, broccoli, onions, garlic, and rhubarb may cause\\naversion to milk or neonatal colic. A common cause of nursing problems is maternal fatigue.\\nInhibition & Suppression of Lactation\\nDespite a recent upsurge in breastfeeding in Western countries, many women will not or cannot\\nbreastfeed, and others will fail in the attempt.

Analgesics\\nare also helpful. Patients will complain of breast engorgement (45%), pain (45%), and leaking breasts\\n(55%). Although the breasts will become considerably engorged and the patient may experience\\ndiscomfort, the collection of milk in the duct system will suppress its production, and reabsorption\\nwill occur. After approximately 2–3 days, engorgement will begin to recede, and the patient will be\\ncomfortable again.

Roman, MD, MPH\\nTechnology for imaging in obstetrics has advanced a great deal over the past decade, but the purpose\\nremains the same: to evaluate the anatomy and well-being of the fetus and the mother. The primary\\nimaging modality in obstetrics is the 2-dimensional (2D) ultrasound because it is safe and widely\\navailable. Three- and 4-dimensional (3D/4D) ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are\\nalso being used in certain situations to enhance imaging techniques, but the cost of these modalities\\nlimits their widespread use. Finally, computed tomography (CT) scan has limited utility because of\\nsafety issues but may be necessary in evaluating certain maternal conditions.\\nULTRASOUND IMAGING\\nUltrasound evaluation uses sound waves at a frequency greater than that which the human ear can hear\\n(>20,000 cycles per second or Hertz [Hz]) to obtain images. An ultrasound examination is performed\\nin real time with images or video clips stored for review. Ultrasound probes contain a transducer that\\ncreates the ultrasound waves at different frequencies. Higher frequency transducers provide better\\nresolution but have less tissue penetrations, whereas low-frequency transducers have lower resolution\\nbut better tissue penetration.\\nIn obstetrics and gynecology, ultrasound imaging is generally performed 1 of 2 ways: either with a\\ntransvaginal probe or transabdominal probe. The choice of which probe to use generally depends on\\nthe structure of interest and its distance from the probe. For instance, imaging of the cervix or an early\\ngestation is generally best achieved with a transvaginal probe, whereas evaluation of the fetus in the\\nthird trimester of pregnancy is best accomplished with transabdominal imaging.\\nUltrasound during pregnancy when performed for medical indications is considered to be safe.\\nThere are no documented harmful effects to the fetus from diagnostic ultrasound. Ultrasound waves,\\nhowever, are a form of energy and have been shown to raise tissue temperature with high energy\\noutput or prolonged exposure. To minimize this risk, it is recommended that energy output, as\\nmeasured by the Mechanical Index, be kept less than 1.0 and that ultrasound be used for diagnostic\\npurposes only (ie, not for entertainment purposes). Imaging of the fetus can be divided into ultrasound\\nevaluations in the first trimester and evaluations in the second and third trimesters. In each trimester,\\nthe goals and the ability to evaluate the fetal anatomy differ.\\nFirst-Trimester Ultrasound Examination\\nThere are a number of indications to perform first-trimester ultrasound. They include confirmation of\\nan intrauterine pregnancy, assessment of pelvic pain and vaginal bleeding, estimation of gestational\\nage, confirmation of viability, evaluation of number of gestations, genetic screening, evaluation of\\nbasic anatomy, and assessment of uterine and adnexal anomalies and pathology.\\nTo begin with, a first-trimester ultrasound can be used to confirm an early pregnancy by\\ndocumenting the location of a gestational sac and the presence or absence of a yolk sac and fetal pole.'),\n",

Gestational age should be determined by\\nmeasuring the length of the fetal pole. If there is no fetal pole noted, the gestational age can be\\nestimated by measuring the mean sac diameter of the gestational sac. To assess for viability, cardiac\\nactivity should be noted by transvaginal ultrasound when the fetal pole measures 4–5 mm, which\\ncorresponds to a gestational age of 6.0–6.5 weeks. Using transabdominal ultrasound, cardiac activity\\nshould be noted when the fetal pole corresponds \\nwith a gestational age of 8 weeks. \\nTable 11–1\\nincludes some guidelines for evaluation of an abnormal pregnancy.

Although there are no official guidelines regarding what constitutes a fetal anatomical\\nsurvey in the first trimester, it is possible to evaluate the fetal brain, spine, stomach, bladder, kidneys,\\nabdominal cord insertion, and extremities during this period. Anatomical survey in the first trimester\\ncan currently detect a number of fetal anomalies, and surely as experience continues to grow, the\\nnumber and type of anomalies detected will also increase.

Therefore, an additional ultrasound is recommended\\nin the second trimester.\\nSecond- and Third-Trimester Ultrasound Examination\\nIn the second and third trimesters, transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound can be used for\\nscreening for chromosomal and nonchromosomal fetal anomalies, fetal growth, fetal well-being, fetal\\nlie and presentation, placental anomalies, and cervical insufficiency.

Anatomy\\nThe fetal anatomical evaluation recommended in current guidelines can be adequately assessed\\ntransabdominally after approximately 18 weeks of gestation and detects approximately 70% of major\\nanatomical anomalies.

Trisomy 13 and trisomy\\n18 fetuses have major structural anomalies that are identifiable by ultrasound in more than 80% of\\ncases. However, fetuses with Down syndrome have major ultrasound-identifiable anomalies in only\\n25% of cases.

Indications for a fetal growth scan include\\nmeasurement of fundal height less than expected based on gestational age, inability to measure fundal\\nheight because of fibroids or maternal obesity, multiple gestations, or maternal or fetal complications\\nof pregnancy that are associated with fetal growth restriction.\\nThe purpose of performing fetal growth scans is to identify fetal growth abnormalities (ie, fetal'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='growth restriction and macrosomia). Intrauterine growth restriction is usually defined as an estimated\\ngestational age less than the 10%. It can be associated with chromosomal and nonchromosomal\\nanomalies, infection, and placental insufficiency. Identification of these fetuses is important because\\ngrowth restriction is associated with fetal demise, and increased surveillance of the growth restricted\\nfetuses may decrease this risk. Macrosomia can be defined as an estimated fetal weight greater than\\n4000 or 4500 g. Identification of these fetuses can be useful because of the association of macrosomia\\nwith postpartum hemorrhage, caesarean delivery, and shoulder dystocia. However, ultrasound is not a\\nperfect estimate of fetal growth. The error rate can be as high as 15–20% depending on the gestational\\nage and certain maternal characteristics such as body habitus and abdominal scar tissue. Also, if\\nultrasounds for growth are performed more often than every 2 weeks, the margin of error may be too\\ngreat to determine whether appropriate growth has occurred. (See \\nChapter 16\\n on Disproportionate\\nFetal Growth for more detail.)\\nC. Evaluation of Fetal Well-Being\\nThe purpose of using ultrasound for fetal surveillance is to identify fetuses that are at risk for\\nintrauterine death or severe morbidity. Ideally, this will allow interventions such as early delivery in\\norder to prevent these complications. Patients that may benefit from fetal surveillance include those\\nwith complaints such as decreased fetal movements, who carry fetuses with intrauterine growth\\nrestriction, or with medical or fetal complications that put them at risk for intrauterine death or severe\\nmorbidity. The 2 main methods of fetal surveillance are the biophysical profile or modified\\nbiophysical profile and Doppler ultrasound.\\n1. Biophysical profile\\n—The biophysical profile (BPP) was first introduced in 1980. It consists of\\nusing 4 ultrasound parameters and a nonstress test to assign a score that gives a fetus’s risk of hypoxia\\nor intrauterine death. \\nTable 11–3\\n shows the scoring of the fetal BPP. A score of 8 or 10 (of a possible\\nscore of 10) is considered normal. A score of 6 is considered equivocal, and a score of 4 or less is\\nconsidered abnormal. Oligohydramnios, regardless of the composite score, warrants further\\nevaluation.\\nTable 11–3\\n. Parameters of the biophysical profile.\\nThe modified BPP consists of performing a nonstress test with only an evaluation of the amniotic\\nfluid volume \\nas measured by the amniotic fluid index (AFI). The AFI is calculated by dividing the\\nuterus into 4 quadrants and measuring the maximum vertical pocket of amniotic fluid in each\\nquadrant. The theory for this is based on the idea that the nonstress test is a measure of short-term'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='fetal status, and the AFI is a measure of long-term fetal status. The AFI can measure long-term status\\nbecause placental dysfunction can cause decreased renal perfusion, which can lead to\\noligohydramnios. If either the nonstress test is not reactive or the amniotic fluid index is less than 5\\ncm, the test is considered nonreactive. The stillbirth rate within a week of testing for a normal BPP or\\nmodified BPP is approximately 0.6–0.8 per 1000, giving a negative predictive value of greater than\\n99.9% for both tests. Risk of adverse pregnancy outcome as correlated with BPP score is shown in\\nTable 11–4\\n.\\nTable 11–4\\n. Interpretation of biophysical profile.\\n2. Fetal Doppler evaluation\\n—Doppler ultrasound is emerging as a newer method to evaluate fetal\\nwell-being. Christian Doppler first described the Doppler effect in the 1800s as a way of describing\\nthe variation in the frequency of a light or sound wave as the source of that wave moves from a fixed\\npoint. In medicine, Doppler ultrasound is used as a measure of the speed at which blood is moving\\nwithin a vessel. The 3 most common fetal arterial Dopplers are measured in the umbilical artery,\\nmiddle cerebral artery, and uterine artery, whereas the most common fetal venous Doppler is\\nmeasured in the ductus venosus. Umbilical artery Dopplers are a reflection of the placental\\ncirculation. As diseases begin to affect the placenta and increase resistance within the placenta, the\\nend-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery begins to slow and eventually may become absent or even\\nreversed.\\nMiddle cerebral artery Dopplers work on a different principle (\\nFig. 11–6\\n). In the presence of fetal\\nhypoxemia, blood flow is redistributed to the brain, known as the brain-sparing effect. As a result, in\\nworsening disease states, blood flow increases in the middle cerebral artery. This measurement can be\\nused both for a general assessment of fetal well-being as well as an assessment for fetal anemia.\\nFinally, ductus venosus Dopplers reflect cardiac compliance and cardiac afterload, which may\\nincrease with disease states that affect the placenta. Therefore, evaluation of the ductus venosus\\nwaveform can be used to assess fetal well-being.'),\n",

Color Doppler is used to\\nidentify the circle of Willis. The Doppler calipers are placed on the proximal third of the middle\\ncerebral artery at a 0-degree angle (ie, dotted line overlaps the length of the middle cerebral artery).\\nThe peak systolic velocity is measured by measuring the peak of the waveforms.\\nD. Placental Location\\nIn addition to the fetus, ultrasound in the second and third trimester can be used to evaluate the\\nplacenta for placental anomalies. It is standard to evaluate the placental location during the anatomy\\nscan or third-trimester growth ultrasound, but if there is vaginal bleeding, one may also evaluate for\\nplacental abruption.\\nThe placenta is usually described by its location, its relationship to the internal cervical os, and its\\nappearance. Specifically, it is important to evaluate the placenta for any evidence of placenta previa.\\nThe distance of the lower edge of the placenta is measured in relation to the internal cervical os. Using\\nultrasound, the relationship of the placenta to the cervix can be described in 1 of 3 ways: complete\\nprevia, marginal previa, and no evidence of previa. If the placenta or placental edge covers the internal\\nos, it is considered a complete placenta previa. A marginal placenta previa occurs when the placental\\nedge is within 2 cm of the internal os but does not cover it. This is clinically significant because a\\nplacenta previa is associated with antenatal and intrapartum vaginal bleeding, and it is recommended\\nthat patients with a placenta previa have a caesarean section for delivery to decrease their risk of\\nexperiencing hemorrhage.\\nThe placenta may also be evaluated for the presence of placenta accreta, which is most commonly\\nassociated with prior uterine surgery. A placenta accreta refers to trophoblastic villi that penetrate the\\ndecidua but not the myometrium and thus result in an abnormally adherent placenta. Other\\nabnormalities of placental attachment include placenta increta, in which the trophoblastic villi\\npenetrate the myometrium, and placenta percreta, in which the trophoblastic villi penetrate the\\nmyometrium and uterine serosa. On ultrasound, a placenta accreta can be suspected when there are\\nplacental lacunae, thinning of the myometrium over the placenta, and loss of the retroplacental\\nhypoechoic space among other findings. Clinically, this is relevant because a placenta accreta can\\nprevent separation of the placenta from the uterus after delivery of the fetus. Antenatal identification\\nof placenta accreta can be used to ensure a planned delivery with the appropriate resources, which can\\nreduce maternal morbidity and mortality.\\nFinally, ultrasound of the placenta can be used to evaluate for vaginal bleeding in the pregnant\\npatient. The most concerning causes of third-trimester vaginal bleeding are placenta previa and'),\n",

Placenta previa may be suspected in the clinical scenario of painless vaginal\\nbleeding and as noted before can be diagnosed by ultrasound. Placental abruption is often suspected\\nwhen there is painful vaginal bleeding, but the sensitivity of ultrasound in diagnosing placental\\nabruption is low. Ultrasound can only visualize hemorrhage in approximately 50% of cases of clinical\\nplacental abruption.\\nMaternal Evaluation\\nUltrasound is also used in pregnancy to evaluate for maternal pathology, such as uterine fibroids and\\novarian cysts or masses. However, imaging of certain maternal structures also has implications for\\nobstetrical outcomes.\\nA. Cervical Evaluation\\nUltrasound can be used to evaluate the cervix in the pregnant patient, as the shape and length of the\\ncervix has been shown to correlate with preterm delivery. The best way to evaluate the cervix is by\\nusing transvaginal ultrasound. The most clinically applicable measurement is that of the cervical\\nlength. This is the distance of the closed cervix from the external os along the endocervical canal to\\nthe innermost closed portion of the cervix. It is also often standard to report the presence or absence of\\nfunneling or opening of the internal os. It is also important that approximately 3–5 minutes be spent\\nevaluating the cervix because of the potential for dynamic changes. The shortest cervical length\\nshould be reported and used for clinical management.\\nThe specific uses of cervical length measurements are rapidly evolving, but it is important to\\nunderstand some basic principles for the use of these measurements. A normal cervical length\\nmeasures between 25 and 50 mm from the mid-second trimester until the third trimester. A cervical\\nlength less than or equal to 25 mm at these gestational ages can be considered abnormal or “short.” In\\nthe third trimester, there is physiologic shortening of the cervix, making the distinction between\\nnormal and abnormal more difficult. The earlier in gestation and the shorter the cervical length, the\\nhigher is the risk of preterm delivery. In \\nTable 11–5\\n, the risk of preterm birth by cervical length at 24\\nweeks is shown.\\nTable 11–5\\n. Sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of cervical length at 24 weeks of gestation\\nfor preterm birth before 35 weeks of gestation.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Cervical length measurements can be used in the second trimester in both low- and high-risk\\nwomen to evaluate the risk for preterm birth.

In the late second and third trimester, cervical length can also be assessed in the\\nsymptomatic patient to help guide the need for hospitalization or the administration of steroids.\\nB. Maternal Doppler Evaluation\\nUterine artery Dopplers are based on the theory that the spiral arterioles of the uterine arteries are\\nmeant to be maximally dilated to ensure adequate blood flow to the uterus.

In the second trimester, obtaining or ascertaining a diagnosis is usually the purpose of\\nthe MRI, whereas in the third trimester, delivery planning is the goal. Abnormal fetal neuroanatomy,\\nspecifically ventriculomegaly, is the most common indication for a fetal MRI. MRI has been shown to\\nalter the diagnosis or improve the accuracy of the diagnosis in up to 50% of studies performed for\\nsuspected fetal central nervous system anomalies. MRI can also be used to evaluate other fetal\\nanomalies, such as genitourinary, gastrointestinal, cardiac, and musculoskeletal anomalies. For\\nexample, genitourinary anomalies are often associated with oligohydramnios, which can affect the\\nimaging quality of ultrasound. MRI, on the other hand, is not dependent on the surrounding tissue, so\\nit can be beneficial in these cases. In addition to fetal imaging, MRI has also been shown to be helpful\\nin evaluating the placenta. In cases of suspected placenta accreta, increta, and percreta, where\\nultrasound findings are equivocal or a posterior placenta limits ultrasound evaluation, MRI can be\\nused to more accurately diagnose the suspected abnormality.\\nFinally, although the safety of ultrasound in obstetrics has been well established, the safety of MRI\\nis sometimes questioned. There have been no studies linking MRI to any teratogenic effects on the\\nfetus. However, gadolinium use is not recommended during pregnancy.

A great\\nmany factors are involved, and the effects of any given factor differ from patient to patient. Outcomes\\ncan include mortality of the mother and/or the fetus/neonate. Leading causes of maternal death\\ninclude thromboembolic disease, hypertensive disease, hemorrhage, infection, and ectopic pregnancy.\\nThe leading causes of infant mortality (death from birth to 1 year of age) are congenital\\nmalformations and prematurity-related conditions. Although there is variation in definition depending\\non the resource, a perinatal death is one that occurs at any time after 28 weeks’ gestation through the\\nfirst 7 days after delivery. The perinatal mortality rate is the number of perinatal deaths per 1000 live\\nbirths. Preterm birth is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and neonatal mortality.\\nIn assessing pregnancies to determine risk, several key concepts may offer tremendous insight.\\nHuman reproduction is a complex social, biochemical, and physiologic process that is not as\\nsuccessful as once thought. Approximately half of all conceptions are lost before pregnancy is even\\nrecognized. Another 15–20% are lost in the first trimester.

Care given in family planning and\\ngynecology centers provides a potential opportunity to maximize maternal and fetal health benefits\\nbefore conception. Issues of potential consequence to a pregnancy, such as medical problems, lifestyle\\n(eg, substance abuse, weight, exercise), or genetic issues should be investigated and interventions\\ndevised before pregnancy. Specific recommendations include folic acid for the prevention of fetal\\nneural tube defects (0.4 mg/d), strict blood sugar control in diabetic women, general management of\\nany medical problems in the mother, avoidance of known teratogenic medications, and smoking\\ncessation.\\nPRENATAL PERIOD\\nInitial Screening\\nThe initial prenatal visit is important in evaluation and assessment of risk during the pregnancy and\\nshould take place as early in the pregnancy as possible, preferably in \\nthe first trimester.

Modality of Conception\\nIt is important to differentiate spontaneous pregnancy from that resulting from assisted reproductive\\ntechnologies (ART). Use of ART increases the risks of perinatal mortality (both stillbirths and early\\nneonatal deaths), multifetal gestation, preterm birth (both singletons and multiples), congenital\\nanomalies, and low birth weight.\\nC. Past Medical History\\nMany medical disorders can complicate the pregnancy course for the mother and thus the fetus. It is\\nimportant that these diseases and their severity be addressed before conception if possible. During\\npregnancy, the patient may require aggressive management and additional visits and testing to follow\\nthe course of the disease, in addition to possible consultation or management of a high-risk specialist.\\nTable 12–2\\n lists some of the most important disorders that may complicate pregnancy.\\nTable 12–2\\n.

Recurrent abortion\\n—A diagnosis of recurrent abortion is made after 3 or more consecutive\\nspontaneous losses of a pregnancy before 20 weeks’ gestation. Recurrent abortion is best investigated\\nbefore another pregnancy occurs; workup can be initiated after 2 losses. If the patient is currently\\npregnant, however, as much of the workup as possible should be performed.\\n• Karyotype of abortus specimen\\n• Parental karyotype\\n• Survey for cervical and uterine anomalies\\n• Screening for hormonal abnormalities (ie, hypothyroidism)\\n• Infectious disease evaluation of the genital tract\\nThe association between inherited thrombophilias and recurrent pregnancy loss is unclear; thus the\\ntesting for these is currently not recommended in the clinical setting. Screening for antiphospholipid\\nantibodies (acquired thrombophilia) may be appropriate.\\n2. Previous stillbirth or neonatal death\\n—A history of previous stillbirth or neonatal death should\\ntrigger an immediate investigation regarding the conditions or circumstances surrounding the event. If\\nthe demise was the result of a nonrecurring event, such as cord prolapse or traumatic injury, then the\\npresent pregnancy has a risk approaching the background risk. However, stillbirth or neonatal death\\nmay suggest a cytogenetic abnormality, structural malformation syndrome, or fetomaternal\\nhemorrhage. Review of records, including autopsy, placental pathology, and karyotype if obtained, is\\nvital. As with fetal loss, the association of unexplained stillbirth with inherited thrombophilias is\\nunclear and testing is not recommended, although a maternal thrombophilia workup may be\\nconsidered with stillbirth in the setting of severe placental thrombosis or infarcts, significant fetal\\ngrowth restriction, or in the patient with a history of thrombosis.\\n3. Previous preterm delivery\\n—A history of preterm birth confers an increased risk of early delivery\\nin subsequent pregnancies. Furthermore, the risk of a subsequent pre-term birth increases as the\\nnumber of prior preterm births increases, and the risk decreases with each subsequent birth that is not\\npreterm. The recurrence risk also rises as the gestational age of the previous preterm delivery\\ndecreases. Despite intense investigation, the incidence of preterm delivery has slightly increased in\\nthe United States, due in large measure to medical intervention producing indicated preterm\\ndeliveries. Eighty-five percent of preterm deliveries occur between 32 and 36 6/7 weeks, and they\\ncarry minimal fetal or neonatal morbidity. The remaining 15% \\nof preterm deliveries, however,\\naccount for nearly all of the perinatal morbidity and mortality. Common causes of perinatal morbidity\\nin premature infants include respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage,\\nbronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, apnea, retinopathy of prematurity, and\\nhyperbilirubinemia. Preterm deliveries can be divided into 2 types: spontaneous and indicated, with\\nindicated preterm deliveries caused by medical or obstetric disorders that place the mother and/or\\nfetus at risk. The clinical risk factors most often associated with spontaneous preterm birth include\\nhistory of previous preterm birth, genital tract infection, nonwhite race, multiple gestation, bleeding in\\nthe second trimester, and low prepregnancy weight. Recent multicenter trials have shown that\\nprogesterone in the form of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone caproate, given as weekly injections of 250 mg\\nbeginning in the second trimester, can decrease the risk of preterm delivery in patients with a history\\nof prior spontaneous preterm delivery.'),\n",

First-Trimester Screening\\nNuchal translucency, measured between 11(0/7) and 13(6/7) weeks, combined with maternal serum\\nfree β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) and pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A levels, has\\nbeen found to have 87.0% sensitivity for detection of trisomy 21, with a 5% false-positive rate. In the\\nabsence of chromosomal abnormalities, an increased nuchal translucency is associated with an\\nincreased risk of structural cardiac abnormalities and skeletal dysplasias, and so forth. Further US\\nfindings in the first trimester, including absence of nasal bone and abnormal ductus venosus Doppler\\nfindings, may further improve the detection rate for aneuploidy but require a high level of sonographic\\nskill. Patients with an abnormal screening result can be offered invasive testing such as chorionic\\nvillus sampling for more accurate detection of fetal aneuploidy. The advantage of the first-trimester\\nscreen (as opposed to second-trimester maternal screening, discussed next) is that it allows for earlier\\ndetection of aneuploidy.\\nB. Second-Trimester Maternal Serum Screening\\nFrequently known as the “triple screen,” this test includes maternal serum α-fetoprotein (MSAFP), β-\\nhCG, and estriol. In some institutions, only the MSAFP is used, whereas in other institutions, a fourth\\ntest for inhibin is included, making it a “quad test.” The usefulness of this screen is its ability to\\nidentify pregnancies at increased risk for open neural tube defects, as well as for certain chromosomal\\nabnormalities, especially trisomy 21 (70% sensitivity for Down syndrome detection). This test is\\neffective at 15–22 weeks’ gestation and therefore can identify an at-risk pregnancy in time to pursue\\nmore definitive diagnosis, if desired. It is important to note, however, that maternal serum screening\\nis not a definitive test and must be followed by invasive testing (discussed later) for karyotype\\ndetermination.\\nThe first- and second-trimester screen should not both be ordered independently during a\\npregnancy; this approach leads to unacceptably high false-positive rates for aneuploidy. Approaches\\nhave been developed, however, that allow for both tests to be used in combination to determine\\naneuploidy risk. One such approach is integrated aneuploidy screening, in which a single risk\\nassessment is calculated using all 6 analytes after completion of both tests. Integrated screening has a\\nDown syndrome detection rate of 95%, with a 5% false-positive rate. One major drawback is the\\nwithholding of information until the second trimester, precluding the benefits of early diagnosis and\\nchorionic villus sampling. Another approach is stepwise sequential screening, which presents patients\\nwith risk-assessment results after completion of the first-trimester component and then again after the\\nsecond-trimester blood draw. With this test, the detection rate for Down syndrome is 95%, with a 5%\\nfalse-positive rate. Combined sequential screening is similar, but patients with a very low first-\\ntrimester risk do not have second-trimester analysis performed.\\nC. Screening for Carriers of Genetic Disease\\nScreening for sickle cell disease should be offered to individuals of African and African American\\ndescent and those from the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, and India. Hemoglobin\\nelectrophoresis is the definitive test to determine the carrier status of sickle cell disease as well as\\nother hemoglobinopathies.\\nCystic fibrosis carrier screening should be discussed with all patients. Carrier rates, however, are\\nhighest in Caucasians, including parents of Eastern European Jewish (or Ashkenazi Jewish) descent.\\nFurthermore, the detection rate of known mutations is highest in these groups and is lower in other\\ngroups. For instance, Asian Americans have a cystic fibrosis carrier rate of 1 in 94, and the detection\\nrate of testing in this population is 49%. Current guidelines recommend offering information'),\n",

Screening is also available for mucolipidosis IV, Niemann-Pick disease \\ntype\\nA, Fanconi’s anemia group C, Bloom’s syndrome, and Gaucher’s disease and may be considered in\\nthis population.\\nPreterm Labor Detection\\nMany patients present throughout pregnancy with signs and symptoms of preterm labor, specifically\\nuterine contractions. Although the cost of missing true preterm labor is high, many patients are not in\\ntrue labor, and the financial cost of aggressive management of these patients is also high. The accurate\\ndiagnosis of preterm labor may be aided by 2 screening tests: cervical length measurement and fetal\\nfibronectin.\\nGestational Diabetes Screening\\nAlthough recent consensus groups have recommended screening for gestational diabetes based on risk\\nfactors, many studies have shown this to be inadequate for detecting patients with gestational\\nscreening versus universal screening.\\nRoutine screening consists of performing a glucose challenge test between 24 and 28 weeks. The\\ntest consists of a 50-g oral glucose load with a plasma glucose level drawn exactly 1 hour after. If the\\nvalue is 140 mg/dL or over, a more specific glucose tolerance test (GTT) should be performed (the\\ncutoff may be lowered to 130 mg/dL to improve sensitivity). The GTT involves obtaining a fasting\\nplasma glucose level, giving a 100-g oral glucose load, then drawing plasma levels at 1 hour, 2 hours,\\nand 3 hours after the glucose load. A test is considered positive for gestational diabetes if 2 of the 4\\nvalues are elevated. The thresholds proposed by Carpenter and Coustan are currently favored (fasting\\n>95 mg/dL, 1 hour >180 mg/dL, 2 hour >155 mg/dL, 3 hour >140 mg/dL).\\nGroup B Streptococcus\\nGroup B streptococcus (GBS) asymptomatically colonizes between 10% and 30% of pregnant women,\\nbut perinatal transmission can result in a severe and potentially fatal neonatal infection. The current\\nGBS testing protocol emphasizes the importance of culture screening and treatment over risk factor–\\nbased screening. For this reason, patients should be screened with a rectovaginal culture at 35–37\\nweeks. If the culture is positive, patients should be treated with intrapartum antibiotics. Intrapartum\\nantibiotic prophylaxis has been shown to decrease the risk of perinatal GBS transmission. If the\\nculture result is unknown, patients should be treated if in preterm labor, with rupture of membranes\\ngreater than or equal to 18 hours, or maternal fever greater than 100.4°F during labor. All patients\\nwith GBS bacteriuria during the pregnancy or a previous neonate with GBS sepsis should be treated\\nwith intrapartum antibiotics.\\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Real-time sonography allows a 2-dimensional (2-D) image to demonstrate fetal anatomy, as well\\nas characteristics such as fetal weight, movement, volume of amniotic fluid, and structural anomalies,\\nsuch as myomas or placenta previa that may affect the pregnancy. Three-dimensional sonography\\nallows volume to be ascertained, creating a 3-D–appearing image on the 2-D screen, which assists in\\nidentifying and clarifying certain anatomic anomalies. Most recently, 4-D machines have been\\ndeveloped, which produce 3-D video in real time. As the machines become more technically advanced\\nand the computers that run them become faster, the images obtained will continue to improve and\\npush the boundaries of sonographic prenatal diagnosis.\\nDiagnostic US is widely used in the assessment of the pregnancy and the fetus and offers a more\\nthan 80% detection rate of anomalies in experienced centers. The benefits and limitations of US\\nshould be discussed with all patients, and the decision to perform a US rests jointly with the physician\\nand the patient.\\nA \\nstandard\\n US examination should provide information such as fetal number, presentation,\\ndocumentation of fetal viability, assessment of gestational age, amniotic fluid volume, placental\\nlocation, fetal biometry, and an anatomic survey of the fetus(es). A \\nlimited\\n US examination is a \\ngoal-\\ndirected search for a suspected problem or finding. A limited US can be used for guidance during\\nprocedures such as amniocentesis or external cephalic version, assessment of fetal well-being, or\\ndocumentation of presentation or placental location intrapartum. A \\nspecialized\\n US examination is\\nperformed when an anomaly is suspected based on history, biochemical abnormalities, or results of\\neither the limited or standard scan. Other specialized examinations include fetal Doppler, biophysical\\nprofile (BPP), fetal echo-cardiogram, or additional biometric studies.\\nUS evaluation of fetal anatomy may detect major structural anomalies. Gross malformations such\\nas anencephaly and hydrocephaly are commonly diagnosed and rarely missed; however, more subtle\\nanomalies such as facial clefts, diaphragmatic hernias, and cardiac defects are more commonly\\nreported to have been missed by US.

The earlier scan allows earlier detection of anomalies that\\nare almost always present by the second trimester, as well as allowing greater detailed viewing of the\\nfetal anatomy by using the higher resolution vaginal transducers.\\nAneuploidy Screening\\nMultiple second-trimester sonographic findings associated with aneuploidy or “markers” of\\naneuploidy have been identified. The presence of single or multiple markers adjusts the patient’s age-\\nrelated risk of aneuploidy based on the particular markers present. Such sonographic findings include,\\nbut are not limited to:\\n• Echogenic intracardiac focus\\n• Choroid plexus cysts\\n• Pyelectasis\\n• Echogenic bowel\\n• Short femur\\n• Increased nuchal fold\\nChorionic Villus Sampling\\nChorionic villus sampling (CVS) is an invasive test performed between 9 and 13 weeks’ gestation and\\ncan be performed either transcervically or transabdominally. CVS is performed under sonographic\\nguidance with the passing of a sterile catheter or needle into the placental site. Chorionic villi are\\naspirated and undergo cytogenetic analysis. The benefit of CVS over amniocentesis is its availability\\nearlier in pregnancy. The overall pregnancy loss rate is higher than that of midtrimester\\namniocentesis, likely as a result of the increased background rate of spontaneous pregnancy loss\\nbetween 9 and 16 weeks; limited data suggest that procedure-related loss rate for CVS appears to\\napproach the rate of midtrimester amniocentesis. One disadvantage of CVS is that, unlike\\namniocentesis, it does not allow diagnosis of neural tube defects.\\nAmniocentesis\\nAmniocentesis is also performed under the guidance of ultrasonography. A needle is inserted\\ntranscutaneously through the maternal abdominal wall into the amniotic cavity, and fluid is removed.\\nThere are many uses for this amniotic fluid. In the early second trimester, these include AFP\\nevaluation for neural tube defect assessment and the most common indication of cytogenetic analysis.\\nIn this case, amniocentesis is often performed between 15 and 20 weeks’ gestation, and fetal cells\\nfrom the amniotic fluid are obtained. Risks associated with the procedure are considered to be very\\nlow, with the risk of abortion as a result of amniocentesis considered to be between 1 in 200 to 1 in\\n450 amniocenteses.\\nAmniocentesis also provides a useful tool later in pregnancy, at low risk, for diagnosis of intra-\\namniotic inflammation and infection as a risk factor for preterm labor and adverse outcome, as well as\\ndocumentation of fetal lung maturity.'),\n",

Perception of 10 distinct movements in a period of up to 2 hours is considered reassuring; if\\nfewer, patients are often advised to undergo further testing.\\nNonstress Test\\nFetal movements associated with accelerations of fetal heart rate (FHR) provide reassurance that the\\nfetus is not acidotic or neurologically depressed. A reactive and therefore reassuring nonstress test\\n(NST) is defined as 2 or more FHR accelerations, at least 15 beats/min above the baseline and lasting\\nat least 15 seconds within a 20-minute period. Vibroacoustic stimulation can elicit FHR accelerations\\nthat can reduce overall testing time without compromising detection of an acidotic fetus. In the case\\nof a nonreassuring NST, further evaluation or delivery depends on the clinical context. In a patient at\\nterm, delivery is warranted. Pregnancy remote from term poses a more challenging dilemma to the\\nclinician. If resuscitative efforts are not successful in restoring reactivity to the NST, then ancillary\\ntests or testing techniques may prove useful in avoiding a premature iatrogenic delivery for\\nnonreassuring FHR patterns, as the false-positive rate may be as high as 50–60%.\\nBiophysical Profile'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='The biophysical profile (BPP) is another way to assess fetal well-being. The BPP is composed of 5\\ncomponents: NST, fetal breathing movements (30 seconds or more in 30 minutes), fetal movement (3\\nor more in 30 minutes), fetal tone (extension/flexion of an extremity), and amniotic fluid volume\\n(vertical pocket of 2 cm or more). Each component is worth 2 points; a score of 8 or 10 is normal, 6 is\\nequivocal, and 4 or less is abnormal. A BPP score of 10/10 or 8/10 with normal amniotic fluid volume\\nis associated with a low risk of fetal asphyxia in the following week (approximately 1 per 1000).\\nModified Biophysical Profile\\nModified BPP combines NST, a short-term indicator of fetal acid–base status, with amniotic fluid\\nindex (AFI), a long-term indicator of placental function. AFI is measured by dividing the uterus into 4\\nequal quadrants and measuring the largest vertical pocket in each quadrant; the results are then\\nsummed and expressed in millimeters. The modified BPP has become a primary mode of antepartum\\nfetal surveillance; a nonreactive NST or an AFI less than 50 mm (oligohydramnios) requires further\\nfetal assessment or intervention.\\nContraction Stress Test\\nThe contraction stress test (CST) is based on the response of FHR to uterine contractions, with the\\npremise that fetal oxygenation will be worsened during contractions. This can result in late\\ndecelerations in an already suboptimally oxygenated fetus. The test requires 3 contractions in 10\\nminutes to be adequate for interpretation. A positive or abnormal test is defined as late decelerations\\noccurring with more than half of the contractions. A test is considered to be suspicious or equivocal if\\nany late decelerations are seen (with fewer than 50% of contractions) and negative with no late\\ndecelerations. Contraindications to CST include any contraindications to labor, such as placenta previa\\nor prior classic caesarean section. This test is now rarely used.\\nGrowth Ultrasound\\nGrowth US studies, performed every 3–4 weeks, are useful for assessment of fetuses that may be at\\nrisk for growth restriction secondary to medical conditions of pregnancy or fetal abnormalities.\\nDoppler Studies\\nFetal Doppler studies initially were used to assess the placenta by evaluation of umbilical artery\\noutflow.

Lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio\\n—The lecithin/sphingomyelin (L/S) ratio for assessment of fetal\\npulmonary maturity was first introduced by Gluck and colleagues in 1971. The test depends on\\noutward flow of pulmonary secretions from the lungs into the amniotic fluid, thereby changing the\\nphospholipid composition of the latter and permitting measurement of the L/S ratio in a sample of\\namniotic fluid. In the absence of complications, the ratio of these 2 components reaches 2.0 at\\napproximately 35 weeks. The presence of blood or meconium may interfere with test interpretation.\\n2. Phosphatidylglycerol\\n—Phosphatidylglycerol (PG) is a minor constituent of surfactant. It begins to\\nincrease appreciably in amniotic fluid several weeks after the rise in lecithin. Its presence is more\\nindicative of fetal lung maturity because PG enhances the spread of phospholipids on the alveoli.\\n3. Fluorescence polarization\\n—The fluorescence polarization test, currently the most widely used\\ntest, uses polarized light to quantitate the competitive binding of a probe to both albumin and\\nsurfactant in amniotic fluid; thus it is a true direct measurement of surfactant concentration. It reflects\\nthe ratio of surfactant to albumin and is measured by an automatic analyzer, such as the TDx-FLM. An\\nelevated ratio has been correlated with the presence of fetal lung maturity; the threshold for maturity\\nis 55 mg of surfactant per gram of albumin.\\nTable 12–4\\n lists all fetal maturity tests available, discriminating levels, and specific characteristics\\nof the tests.\\nTable 12–4\\n.

The patient may or may not experience\\npain or cramping; however, there is no passage of products of conception and no cervical dilation.\\nComplete abortion\\n is the expulsion of all of the products of conception before the 20th completed\\nweek of gestation, whereas \\nincomplete abortion\\n is the expulsion of some, but not all, of the products\\nof conception. \\nInevitable abortion\\n refers to bleeding from within the uterus before the 20th week,\\nwith dilation of the cervix but without expulsion of the products of conception. The term \\nmissed\\nabortion\\n describes a nonviable pregnancy that has been retained in the uterus without cervical dilation\\nand without the spontaneous passage of products of conception. In \\nseptic abortion\\n, embryonic or fetal\\ndemise has occurred, and intrauterine infection has developed, which has the potential risk of\\nspreading systemically.\\nAlthough the true incidence of spontaneous abortion is unknown, approximately 15% of clinically\\nevident pregnancies and up to 50% of chemically evident pregnancies end in spontaneous abortion.\\nEighty percent of spontaneous abortions occur before 12 weeks’ gestation.\\nThe incidence of abortion is influenced by the age of the mother and by a number of pregnancy-\\nrelated factors, including the number of previous spontaneous abortions, a previous intrauterine fetal\\ndemise, and a previous infant born with malformations or known genetic defects.

The incidence decreases to 20–30% of second-trimester losses and to 5–10% of third-\\ntrimester losses. The majority of chromosome abnormalities are trisomies (56%), followed by\\npolyploidy (20%) and monosomy X (18%).\\nOther suspected causes of spontaneous abortion are less common, and these include infection,\\nanatomic defects, endocrine factors, immunologic factors, and exposure to toxic substances. In a\\nsignificant percentage of spontaneous abortions, the etiology is unknown, even with genetic testing.\\nA. Genetic Abnormalities\\nAneuploidy, an abnormal chromosomal number, is the most common genetic abnormality, accounting\\nfor up to 50% of clinical miscarriages. Monosomy X or Turner’s syndrome is the single most common\\naneuploidy, comprising approximately 18% of these gestations. As a group, the autosomal trisomies\\naccount for more than half of aneuploid losses, with \\ntrisomy 16 being the most common. Autosomal\\ntrisomies have been noted for every chromosome except chromosome number 1. Most trisomic\\npregnancies end in miscarriage. The exceptions are trisomy 21, 18, and 13, which have survival to\\nbirth rates of 22%, 5%, and 3%, respectively.\\nPolyploidy, usually in the form of triploidy, is found in approximately 20% of all miscarriages.\\nPolyploid conceptions typically result in an anembryonic gestation. Occasionally, these pregnancies\\nwill develop into partial hydatidiform moles.\\nThe remaining half of early abortuses appear to have normal chromosomes. Of these, 20% have\\nother genetic abnormalities that may account for the loss. Mendelian or polygenic factors resulting in\\nanatomic defects may play a role.

Pregnancy Tests\\nFalling or abnormally rising serum levels of β-human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) are diagnostic of\\nan abnormal pregnancy, either a failed intrauterine gestation or an ectopic pregnancy.\\nUltrasound Findings\\nTransvaginal ultrasound is an essential diagnostic tool in diagnosing early normal and abnormal\\npregnancies.

At 5–6 weeks’ gestation, a yolk sac will be present. In general, a gestational sac with a\\nmean sac diameter (MSD) of ≥8 mm should contain a yolk sac. Similarly, a gestational sac with an\\nMSD of >16 mm should also contain an embryo (\\nFig. 13–6\\n). Pregnancies with a large gestational sac\\nand no embryo are typically anembryonic gestations and are managed in a similar manner as a missed\\nabortion (\\nFig. 13–5\\n).

Miscarriage becomes increasingly less likely the further the gestation\\nprogresses. If a viable fetus of 6 weeks or less is seen on ultrasound, the risk of miscarriage is\\napproximately 15–30%. The risk decreases to 5–10% at 7–9 weeks’ gestation and to less than 5% after\\n9 weeks’ gestation.\\nIn an incomplete abortion, the gestational sac usually is irregularly shaped. Heterogenous,\\nechogenic material representing retained products of conception is seen within the uterus. Endometrial\\nthickness can be helpful in diagnosing an incomplete abortion; however, there is no consensus on a\\ncutoff value to distinguish complete miscarriage from incomplete miscarriage. Color Doppler can be\\nused to assess for flow within the tissue and can help differentiate retained products of conception that\\nremain implanted within the uterus from tissue or blood that is in the process of expulsion. Thus, a\\ncombination of clinical and ultrasound findings must be used to determine management.\\nThe diagnosis of complete abortion is also based on clinical findings. On ultrasound, the\\nendometrial lining appears thin, and no products of conception are visible within the cavity.\\nImportantly, a complete abortion is only diagnosed with certainty if a previous intrauterine gestation\\nwas documented on ultrasound.

A slower decline is suggestive of an ectopic pregnancy.\\nComplications\\nSevere or persistent bleeding during or after spontaneous abortion may be life-threatening.

Infection, intrauterine\\nadhesions (Asherman’s syndrome), and infertility are other complications of abortion.\\nPerforation of the uterus may occur during procedures to remove retained products of conception,\\nnamely D&C. The rate of perforation during the first and second trimesters is approximately 0.5% for\\nboth induced and spontaneous abortions.

In the past, surgery was the standard of care because of concern that medical\\nor expectant management would lead to higher rates of retained pregnancy tissue and subsequent\\ninfection. More recently, expectant or medical management are acceptable alternatives and have even\\nshown lower rates of infection despite their higher rates of retained products of conception. These\\npatients also avoid the risks of surgery, including uterine perforation, intrauterine adhesions, and\\ncervical insufficiency. The advantages of performing a D&C include convenient timing and low rates\\nof retained products of conception.\\nExpectant management allows the spontaneous passage of products of conception and avoids risks\\nof surgery. Risks and side effects include unpredictable timing until the abortion is completed with the\\npossibility of significant pain and bleeding, occasionally requiring emergent D&C. Expectant\\nmanagement also has the highest rates of retained pregnancy tissue, necessitating treatment with\\nmisoprostol (prostaglandin E1) or D&C.\\nPatients who choose medical management are given misoprostol, a drug that induces uterine\\ncontractions and expulsion of the products of conception.

Recurrent pregnancy loss affects up to 5% of\\ncouples, often with no identifiable cause. The prognosis for a successful subsequent pregnancy\\ncorrelates with the number of previous miscarriages. The risk of spontaneous abortion in a first\\npregnancy is approximately 15%, and this risk is at least doubled in women experiencing recurrent\\npregnancy loss.\\nOverall, the prognosis after repeated losses is good, with most couples having an approximately\\n60% chance of a viable pregnancy.\\nPathogenesis & Treatment\\nDetermining the etiology of recurrent miscarriage involves a comprehensive workup. This evaluation\\ncan be divided into 6 categories of possible causes: genetic, immunologic, endocrinologic, anatomic,\\nmicrobiologic, and thrombophilic.\\nTable 13–1\\n summarizes a diagnostic workup and possible therapies for recurrent abortion.\\nTable 13–1\\n.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='A. Genetic Errors\\nGenetic errors associated with recurrent pregnancy loss include maternal and paternal karyotype\\nabnormalities and recurrent aneuploidy.\\nA structural genetic factor is found in either partner in up to 8% of couples with recurrent\\nmiscarriage. Of these, balanced translocations are the most common and are found more frequently in\\nthe female partner. Less frequent findings include chromosome insertions, deletions, and inversions.\\nWhen a karyotypic abnormality is found, genetic counseling should be provided because the\\nlikelihood of a subsequent healthy birth depends on the chromosome(s) involved and the type of\\nrearrangement. Although couples affected by a structural genetic defect are more likely to have a\\nmiscarriage, the subsequent live birth rate can be as high as 70%. Despite the good prognosis, some\\npatients opt for treatment with ART. If the defect is paternal, artificial insemination by a donor is\\navailable. For a maternal defect, a donor egg may be fertilized by the husband’s sperm.\\nPreimplantation genetic diagnosis is also available for parents who wish to use their own gametes.\\nIn couples with normal karyotypes, recurrent fetal aneuploidy can be the cause of miscarriage. The\\nmost common aneuploidies found are the trisomies. Although miscarriages caused by trisomies are\\nusually random events, the frequency of such events increases with advancing maternal age. In the\\ngeneral reproductive population, however, a trisomic miscarriage does not increase the risk of having\\na similar outcome in the next pregnancy. As a result, recurrent pregnancy loss with normal fetal\\nchromosomes carries an overall higher recurrence risk, as this subset is presumably caused by\\nmaternal or paternal etiologies.\\nB. Uterine & Cervical Abnormalities\\nAnatomic abnormalities were the first described causes of recurrent miscarriage and account for up to\\n15% of recurrent \\npregnancy losses. Defects include congenital uterine anomalies, cervical\\ninsufficiency, submucosal leiomyomas and endometrial polyps, malformations from DES exposure in\\nutero, and Asherman’s syndrome.\\nThe most common uterine malformation is a uterine septum. This anomaly is associated with first-\\ntrimester losses, presumably because of implantation failure on the relatively avascular septum. Other\\nmüllerian fusion abnormalities such as bicornuate and unicornuate uterus are less common and are\\nmore likely to cause second-trimester miscarriage or preterm delivery. Similarly, anomalies caused by\\nDES exposure (eg, T-shaped uterus) can lead to second-trimester loss.\\nStructural defects such as submucosal leiomyomas and endometrial polyps likely interfere with\\nimplantation. In Asherman’s syndrome, implantation is impeded by the presence of intrauterine\\nadhesions and fibrosis. This scarring can also impair adequate blood supply to the endometrium.\\nDiagnosis of uterine defects is usually accomplished with transvaginal ultrasound. A specific type of\\ntransvaginal ultrasound, in which saline is infused into the endometrial cavity (eg, saline infusion\\nsonography), can help delineate defects such as leiomyomas, polyps, and intrauterine adhesions.\\nHysterosalpingogram or magnetic resonance imaging can detect uterine malformations. Treatment is\\nprimarily surgical, and minimally invasive procedures using hysteroscopy can be performed in many\\ncases.\\nCervical insufficiency classically presents in the second trimester with painless cervical dilation.\\nAlthough no definite cause is found in many patients, cervical insufficiency has been associated with\\ncongenital uterine anomalies, trauma from procedures that dilate the cervix (eg, D&C), and excisional\\nprocedures such as a loop electrosurgical excision procedure or cold-knife conization.\\nIf other causes of recurrent pregnancy loss are excluded and the presumed etiology is cervical\\ninsufficiency, a cervical cerclage is recommended between 13 and 16 weeks’ gestation. Success rates'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='with cerclage are 85–90%. Complications include bleeding, infection, rupture of membranes, and\\nmiscarriage. Contraindications to cerclage placement include bleeding of unknown etiology, infection,\\nlabor, ruptured membranes, and known fetal anomalies.\\nC. Endocrine Factors\\nPossible endocrine causes of recurrent miscarriage include thyroid disorders, hyperprolactinemia,\\npoorly controlled diabetes mellitus, and luteal phase defect (eg, progesterone insufficiency).\\nLuteal phase defect (LPD) is thought to result from a deficiency in progesterone; however, the\\ndiagnosis remains controversial. Critics of this diagnosis note intraobserver and interobserver\\nvariations in biopsy results, the presence of LPD in normal women, and inconsistent results in women\\ndiagnosed with LPD. Furthermore, controlled studies demonstrating an improvement in pregnancy\\noutcome with progesterone treatment are lacking. For these reasons, many experts are skeptical about\\nthe importance of LPD as an etiology of recurrent pregnancy loss.\\nThe proposed mechanism in LPD is a relative lack of progesterone that causes a delay in\\nendometrial development, preventing normal implantation. Inadequate hormonal support of the\\nembryo may also be involved. In the past, the diagnosis of LPD was made by luteal phase endometrial\\nbiopsies that showed a lag in endometrial development when compared with the current day of the\\ncycle. More recently, midluteal progesterone levels of <10 ng/mL have been used to diagnose an\\ninadequate luteal phase. LPD is treated with supplemental progesterone.\\nUntreated hypothyroidism increases the risk of miscarriage. Hypothyroidism is diagnosed with a\\nsensitive thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and patients should be euthyroid before attempting\\npregnancy. Hyperprolactinemia may be associated with recurrent pregnancy loss by competing with\\nthe hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian axis, resulting in insufficient folliculogenesis, oocyte maturation,\\nand/or a LPD. Treatment of hyperprolactinemia with a dopamine agonist may improve pregnancy\\noutcomes. Patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus can similarly have an increased risk of\\nmiscarriage. These risks for recurrent pregnancy loss highlight the importance of diagnosing and\\ntreating underlying medical problems.\\nD. Infection\\nInfections such as \\nToxoplasma gondii, Listeria monocytogenes\\n, herpes simplex, and cytomegalovirus\\nhave been implicated in spontaneous abortion, although a causal relationship has not been defined. No\\ninfectious agents have been clearly linked to recurrent pregnancy loss.\\nE. Immunologic Factors\\nAntiphospholipid syndrome is an autoimmune disorder defined by the presence of characteristic\\nclinical features and antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin\\nantibodies). The most common and serious complications of this disorder are venous and arterial\\nthrombosis, in which the majority of thrombotic events are venous. The risk of thrombosis is\\nsignificantly increased during pregnancy. Although the exact mechanism is unclear, the increased\\nthrombotic potential in women with antiphospholipid syndrome is associated with recurrent\\npregnancy loss after 10 weeks’ gestation. Therapy with aspirin with or without heparin has been\\nshown to reduce pregnancy loss.\\nWomen with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) have a higher rate of miscarriage and pregnancy\\nloss in all trimesters. The prevalence of antiphospholipid antibodies in patients with SLE is estimated\\nat 37%, and such antibodies are the most sensitive indicator of poor pregnancy outcomes.\\nPreviously, the sharing of human leukocyte antigens between partners was thought to be associated'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='with recurrent pregnancy loss. More recent studies, including a large, randomized controlled trial, do\\nnot support this theory. Despite the lack of diagnostic tests to identify an alloimmune factor\\nassociated with early pregnancy loss, there is evidence that there are immunologic interactions\\nbetween the mother and her allogeneic pregnancy. Investigation is currently underway looking at the\\nefficacy of active and passive immunotherapy in preventing recurrent miscarriage.\\nF. Thrombophilia\\nCertain inherited or acquired thrombophilic factors are associated with an increased risk of venous\\nthromboembolism. These include a group of inherited gene mutations that predispose to arterial\\nand/or venous thrombosis: factor V Leiden mutation, prothrombin gene mutation,\\nhyperhomocysteinemia, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase polymorphisms, and deficiencies in\\nprotein S, protein C, and antithrombin III. Despite the association between inherited thrombophilias\\nand venous thromboembolism, a definitive causal link cannot be made between these diseases and\\nuteroplacental thrombosis leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes.\\nTesting for maternal inherited thrombophilia may be considered when there is a personal history of\\nthromboembolism in the absence of other risk factors such as surgery or prolonged immobilization.\\nTesting is also indicated when a first-degree relative has a history of a high-risk thrombophilia or\\nvenous thromboembolism before age 50 years in the absence of risk factors. Currently, recurrent\\npregnancy loss is not an indication to screen for thrombophilias, with the exception of\\nantiphospholipid antibodies. Likewise, there are insufficient data that treatment with heparin or other\\nanticoagulant therapies improves pregnancy outcomes in women with inherited thrombophilia and\\nrecurrent pregnancy loss.\\nAllison JL, Schust DJ.

(Reproduced, with permission, from: Benson RC.\\nHandbook of Obstetrics & Gynecology\\n. 8th ed. Los Altos, CA: Lange; 1983.)\\nEctopic pregnancy occurs in approximately 1.5–2.0% of all pregnancies. The incidence has\\nincreased from 4.5 per 1000 in 1970 to 19.7 per 1000 in 1992, the last time data were reported by the\\nUS Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \\nThis may be due, at least in part, to a higher incidence\\nof pelvic inflammatory disease, use of assisted reproductive technology, and higher rates of tubal\\nsterilization.\\nThe morbidity and mortality associated with ectopic pregnancy has decreased dramatically, mainly\\nbecause of earlier diagnosis with ultrasound and hCG levels and subsequent treatment before rupture.\\nNevertheless, ectopic pregnancy is the leading cause of pregnancy-related death in the first trimester\\nand accounts for 4–10% of all pregnancy-related deaths.\\nClassification & Incidence\\nEctopic pregnancy can be classified as follows (\\nFig. 13–7\\n).\\n1.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='incidence ranges from 1 in 100 to 1 in 500 with assisted reproductive technologies.\\nThere are many known risk factors for ectopic pregnancy, such as previous pelvic inflammatory\\ndisease, current and past smoking, and the presence of an intrauterine device (IUD). Despite our\\nknowledge of these predisposing factors, up to one-third of ectopic pregnancies occur in women\\nwithout any apparent risk factors.\\nA. Tubal Factors\\nDamage to the fallopian tube from a number of factors increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy. In\\npelvic inflammatory disease (PID), microorganisms ascend from the lower genital tract, infecting and\\ncausing inflammation of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. Salpingitis can result in damage to\\nfallopian tube cilia and blockage or closure of the tube. PID can also lead to adhesion formation\\namong pelvic organs.\\nOther causes of distorted tubal anatomy leading to an increased risk of ectopic pregnancy include\\nprevious tubal surgery, endometriosis, uterine leiomyomas, and developmental abnormalities of the\\ntube or abnormal tubal anatomy from in utero DES exposure. Up to one-third of pregnancies after\\ntubal ligation and approximately 7% of pregnancies after sterilization reversal are ectopic.\\nAdditionally, one-third of pregnancies after an ectopic pregnancy are also ectopic implantations.\\nB. Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART)\\nThe rate of ectopic pregnancy with ART ranges from 2.1% to as high as 8.6% of all clinical\\npregnancies. The etiology of ectopic pregnancy in patients undergoing ART and in vitro fertilization\\n(IVF) is not completely understood, but several theories are currently under investigation.\\nMedications used to increase ovarian follicle production result in high levels of progesterone and\\nestradiol that may affect tubal peristalsis and uterine relaxation. Women with tubal factor infertility\\nundergoing IVF have even higher rates of ectopic pregnancy, and most physicians will recommend\\nremoval of diseased tubes before IVF. Ectopic pregnancy rates are associated with the number of\\ntransferred embryos as well as placement of the embryos.\\nC. Other Factors\\nPregnancy is uncommon in women who use an IUD for contraception. However, approximately 5% of\\npregnancies that do occur in women using an IUD are ectopic pregnancies. Nevertheless, women with\\nan IUD are overall less likely to develop an ectopic pregnancy than women who do not use\\ncontraception. Smoking also significantly increases the risk of ectopic pregnancy, likely because\\ncigarette smoke affects cilia and smooth muscle function in the fallopian tube.\\nTiming of Rupture\\nRupture of an ectopic pregnancy is usually spontaneous. Isthmic pregnancies tend to rupture earliest,\\nat 6–8 weeks’ gestation, because of the small diameter of this portion of the tube. Ampullary\\npregnancies rupture later, generally at 8–12 weeks. Interstitial pregnancies are the last to rupture,\\nusually at 12–16 weeks, as the myometrium allows more room for the ectopic to grow. Interstitial\\nrupture is quite dangerous because its proximity to uterine and ovarian vessels can result in massive\\nhemorrhage.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention and early treatment of sexually transmitted diseases is important to prevent tubal damage\\nand subsequent ectopic pregnancy. Smoking cessation can also help reduce the risk of ectopic'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='pregnancy. Smoking decreases the motility of the fallopian tube cilia and makes a fertilized egg less\\nlikely to traverse the tube normally. Unfortunately, other known risk factors are more difficult to\\ncontrol, and up to one-third of ectopic pregnancies occur without any associated risk factors.\\nClinical Findings\\nNo specific symptoms or signs are pathognomonic for ectopic pregnancy, and many disorders can\\npresent similarly. Normal pregnancy, threatened or incomplete abortion, ovarian cyst rupture, ovarian\\ntorsion, gastroenteritis, and appendicitis can all be confused with ectopic pregnancy. \\nBecause early\\ndiagnosis is crucial, a high index of suspicion should be maintained when any pregnant woman in the\\nfirst trimester presents with bleeding and/or abdominal pain.\\nA. Symptoms\\nThe following symptoms may assist in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy.\\n1. Pain\\n—Pelvic or abdominal pain is present in almost 100% of cases. Pain can be unilateral or\\nbilateral, localized or generalized. The presence of subdiaphragmatic or shoulder pain is suggestive of\\nintraabdominal bleeding. In tubal ectopic pregnancy, implantation typically occurs in the wall of the\\ntube, in the connective tissue beneath the serosa. There may be little or no decidual reaction within the\\ntube and minimal defense against the permeating trophoblast. The trophoblast invades blood vessels,\\ncausing local hemorrhage. A hematoma in the subserosal space enlarges as the pregnancy grows, and\\nprogressive distention of the tube eventually leads to pain and rupture.\\n2. Bleeding\\n—Abnormal uterine bleeding occurs in roughly 75% of cases and represents decidual\\nsloughing. Bleeding usually presents as intermittent, light spotting; however, bleeding may be heavier.\\nA decidua cast is passed in 5–10% of ectopic pregnancies and may be mistaken for products of\\nconception. Vaginal bleeding is of endometrial origin and results when the decidua breaks down from\\nlack of progesterone support, a hallmark of an abnormal pregnancy. Occasionally the entire decidua\\nmay be shed in one or more large pieces as a decidual cast of the endometrial cavity. On pathologic\\nexamination, only decidua is seen, whereas chorionic villi are notably absent.\\n3. Amenorrhea\\n—Secondary amenorrhea is variable. Approximately half of women with ectopic\\npregnancies have some bleeding at the time of their expected menses and may not realize they are\\npregnant.\\n4. Syncope\\n—Dizziness, lightheadedness, and/or syncope may be part of the initial presentation and\\nshould raise suspicion for intraabdominal bleeding from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\\nB. Signs\\nOn examination, the following signs are important in the diagnosis of ectopic gestation.\\n1. Tenderness\\n—Diffuse or localized abdominal tenderness is present in the majority of patients with\\nectopic pregnancies. Adnexal and/or cervical motion tenderness is also a common finding.\\n2. Adnexal Mass\\n—A unilateral adnexal mass is palpated in one-third to one-half of patients. More\\noften, unilateral adnexal fullness rather than a discrete mass is appreciated. Occasionally, a cul-de-sac\\nmass is noted.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='3. Uterine changes\\n—The uterus may undergo the typical changes of pregnancy, including softening\\nand a slight increase in size.\\n4. Hemodynamic instability\\n—Vital signs will reflect the hemodynamic status of patients with tubal\\nrupture and intraabdominal bleeding.\\nC. Laboratory Findings\\n1. Hematocrit\\n—The hematocrit is an important initial test that indirectly assesses the hemodynamic\\nstatus of the patient and reflects the amount of intraabdominal bleeding.\\n2. β-hCG\\n—The qualitative serum or urine hCG assay is positive in virtually 100% of ectopic\\npregnancies. A positive result, however, does not help distinguish an intrauterine from ectopic\\npregnancy. More helpful is a quantitative hCG value that, in conjunction with transvaginal ultrasound,\\ncan often make the diagnosis. If ultrasound is nondiagnostic (eg, in an early ectopic, early normal\\npregnancy, or early failed pregnancy), serial hCG values can be followed. The hCG level should rise at\\na minimum of 53% over 48 hours in a normal pregnancy. An inappropriate rise in hCG has a\\nsensitivity of 99% for an abnormal gestation. Of note, two-thirds of ectopic pregnancies have\\nabnormally rising values, whereas the remaining third show a normal progression.\\n3. Progesterone\\n—Serum progesterone levels may help confirm an ectopic pregnancy diagnosis.\\nSerum progesterone values are independent of hCG levels. A serum progesterone level less than 5\\nng/mL has a 100% specificity for identifying an abnormal pregnancy, but does not identify the\\nlocation of the pregnancy. Progesterone levels greater than 20 ng/mL are associated with normal\\nintrauterine pregnancies. All values in between 5 and 20 ng/mL are equivocal.\\nC. Diagnostic Tests\\n1. Ultrasound\\n—Ultrasound is an essential part of the evaluation for an ectopic pregnancy. An initial\\ntransvaginal ultrasound can be used to visualize an intrauterine pregnancy or a definite ectopic\\ngestation. If neither diagnosis is made, the patient is considered to have a “pregnancy of unknown\\nlocation.” Approximately 25–50% of women with an ectopic pregnancy initially present in this\\nmanner. An intrauterine pregnancy may not be visualized because the gestational sac has not yet\\ndeveloped or has collapsed. Likewise, an early ectopic pregnancy may be too small to be detected by\\nultrasound. When a diagnosis cannot be made, the patient is then followed with serial hCG levels and\\nultrasound until either an ectopic pregnancy, intrauterine gestation, or early pregnancy failure is\\nconfirmed.\\nIn general, ultrasound should detect an intrauterine gestation when the hCG value falls within or\\nsurpasses the “discriminatory zone,” defined as an hCG value between 1500 and 2000 mIU/mL. If the\\nhCG level is higher than the discriminatory zone, and the transvaginal ultrasound is \\nnondiagnostic,\\nectopic pregnancy or early abnormal pregnancy is likely. Caution should be used when interpreting\\nhCG values because they may be falsely elevated in a pregnancy with multiple gestations.\\nA normal intrauterine sac appears regular and well defined on ultrasound. It has been described as\\nan echolucent area having a “double ring” or “double decidual” sign, which represents the decidual\\nlining and the chorion around the early gestational sac. In ectopic pregnancy, ultrasound may reveal\\nonly a thickened, decidualized endometrium. Decidual sloughing results in intracavitary fluid or blood\\nand creates the so-called pseudogestational sac, a small and irregular structure that may be confused\\nwith an intrauterine gestational sac.\\nThe presence of an adnexal mass with an empty uterus raises the suspicion for an ectopic'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='pregnancy, especially if the hCG titers are above the discriminatory zone. Visualization of a\\ngestational sac with a yolk sac or embryo within the adnexa confirms the diagnosis; however, it is\\nmore common to find a hyperechoic “tubal ring” or complex mass within the adnexae (\\nFig. 13–8\\n). If\\nrupture has occurred, anechoic or echogenic free fluid in the cul-de-sac may be visualized.\\nFigure 13–8\\n. Empty uterus (U) with an adnexal mass (A) suspicious for an ectopic pregnancy.\\nUltrasound is increasingly being relied on to differentiate several less common types of ectopic\\npregnancies. Both interstitial tubal and caesarean section scar pregnancies can be difficult to\\ndistinguish from intrauterine gestations because of their proximity to the intrauterine cavity.\\nThe most likely alternative diagnosis of an adnexal mass in early pregnancy is a corpus luteum\\ncyst, which can also rupture and bleed, thus making its distinction from an ectopic pregnancy\\nchallenging.\\n2. Laparoscopy\\n—In the past, laparoscopy was often used to diagnosis ectopic pregnancy. In current\\npractice, however, transvaginal ultrasound has replaced laparoscopy as the preferred diagnostic tool.\\nCompared with laparoscopy, ultrasound is equally effective in confirming the presence or absence of\\nectopic pregnancy. Ultrasound also has the advantages of being both cost-effective and noninvasive.\\nIn terms of surgical treatment for ectopic pregnancy, laparoscopy is the standard method, assuming\\nthe patient is hemo-dynamically stable.\\n3. D&C\\n—D&C can be performed to confirm or exclude intrauterine pregnancy. D&C is usually\\nperformed when an early ectopic or abnormal intrauterine gestation is suspected based on hCG levels\\nand ultrasound. D&C should not be performed if a pregnancy is desired because it may remove a\\nnormal, early intrauterine gestation. If chorionic villi are seen on pathology examination of the D&C\\nspecimen, an intrauterine pregnancy is confirmed. On the other hand, if only decidua is obtained on\\nD&C, ectopic pregnancy is highly likely.\\n4. Laparotomy\\n—Immediate surgery is indicated in the hemodynamically unstable patient with a\\npresumed ectopic pregnancy. Laparoscopy is generally the preferred surgical method for evaluation of\\nsuspected ectopic pregnancy in the stable patient; however, exploratory laparotomy can provide rapid'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='access to control intraabdominal hemorrhage. Laparotomy also may be performed if the laparoscopic\\napproach does not allow adequate visualization or if scar tissue from previous surgeries makes the\\nlaparoscopic approach too difficult.\\n5. Culdocentesis\\n—Culdocentesis, the vaginal passage of a needle into the posterior cul-de-sac, was\\nonce used to confirm the presence of hemoperitoneum. This technique has now been replaced by\\ntransvaginal ultrasound and is rarely performed in modern medicine.\\n6. Magnetic resonance imaging\\n—Magnetic resonance imaging is a useful adjunct to ultrasound in\\ncases in which an unusual ectopic location is suspected. The location of the ectopic pregnancy and\\nrecognition of cervical, caesarean scar, or interstitial pregnancy determines the options for treatment\\nand management. In these types of ectopic pregnancy, conservative treatment with methotrexate is\\noften preferred and usually attempted before surgery to avoid the potential catastrophic hemorrhage\\nassociated with surgical management in these cases.\\nTreatment\\nA. Expectant Management\\nExpectant management is appropriate and can be successful in a select population of patients. In\\ngeneral, these women should be asymptomatic, with lower starting hCG levels and evidence that the\\nectopic pregnancy is spontaneously resolving (eg, decreasing hCG levels). If the initial hCG level is\\nless than 200 mU/mL, 88% of patients experience resolution with \\nexpectant management. These\\nwomen should be educated about the potential risks of tubal rupture, intraabdominal bleeding, and the\\nneed for emergent surgery.\\nB. Medical Management\\nMethotrexate (MTX) is a drug that inhibits the action of dihydrofolate reductase, thereby inhibiting\\nDNA synthesis. MTX affects actively proliferating tissues such as bone marrow, intestinal mucosa,\\nmalignant cells, and trophoblastic tissue. This antimetabolite can be considered for women who are\\nhemodynamically stable with a confirmed ectopic pregnancy or if clinical suspicion is high for an\\nectopic pregnancy. Although treatment of early ectopic pregnancy with MTX has significantly\\ndecreased the number of women who need surgery, there are several contraindications to its use.\\nEmbryonic cardiac motion or the presence of a gestational sac larger than 3.5 cm are relative\\ncontraindications to MTX due to the higher rate of treatment failure in patients with either one of\\nthese findings. The level of hCG is also predictive of MTX success. With hCG values greater than\\n5000 mIU/mL, the failure rate is 14% with a single dose of MTX compared with 3.7% with a\\nmultiple-dose regimen. Because MTX affects rapidly dividing tissues within the body, it should not be\\ngiven to women with blood dyscrasias or active gastrointestinal or respiratory disease.

In\\nsome instances, previous surgeries with subsequent intraabdominal adhesions makes laparotomy the\\npreferred approach. Tubal pregnancies can be treated with either linear salpingostomy or\\nsalpingectomy. The decision to perform either procedure depends on the patient’s desire for future\\nfertility as well as the appearance of the contralateral tube. If the contralateral tube appears abnormal\\nand fertility is desired, a linear salpingostomy can be performed, and future fertility seems to be\\nimproved. In this technique, an incision is made along the fallopian tube, proximal to the ectopic\\npregnancy. The gestational tissue is gently removed from the tube with an effort to remove the ectopic\\nin one piece. \\nPatients who undergo linear salpingostomy are at risk for having persistent trophoblastic\\ntissue and must be evaluated with weekly hCG levels until undetectable. hCG levels may remain\\nelevated in up to 20% of patients who have undergone salpingostomy. In these cases, MTX is given,\\nwith high rates of resolution. Linear salpingostomy also increases the risk of a second ectopic\\npregnancy occurring in this tube, with rates up to 15%. In general, if the contralateral tube is normal,\\nsalpingectomy should be performed to reduce the risk of subsequent ectopic pregnancy.\\nSalpingectomy (removal of the fallopian tube) is preferred if the patient has completed child\\nbearing, if the affected tube appears damaged, or if salpingostomy has already been performed on that\\ntube. Salpingectomy is a simpler technique and carries minimal risk of retained trophoblastic tissue\\nand postoperative tubal bleeding.\\nInterstitial pregnancies are uncommon, accounting for only 2–4% of all ectopic pregnancies. MTX\\nand surgery can be offered to these patients. Expectant management is currently not recommended\\nbecause it has not been well studied in these patients and the risks are considered greater than for tubal\\nectopics.

Although there is no strict definition in the\\nliterature regarding the amount of uterine contractions required for preterm labor, there is consensus\\nthat contractions need to be regular and at frequent intervals. Generally, more than 4 contractions per\\nhour are needed to cause cervical change. The uterine contractions need not be painful to cause\\ncervical change and may manifest themselves as abdominal tightening, lower back pain, or pelvic\\npressure. In addition, there must be demonstrated cervical effacement or dilatation to meet a diagnosis\\nof preterm labor.\\nIt is important to distinguish preterm labor from other similar clinical entities, such as cervical\\nincompetence (cervical change in the absence of uterine contractions) and preterm uterine\\ncontractions (regular contractions in the absence of cervical change) because the treatment for these\\nsituations differs. Cervical incompetence may require cerclage placement, and preterm uterine\\ncontractions without cervical change is generally a self-limited phenomenon that resolves\\nspontaneously and requires no intervention. If ruptured membranes accompany preterm labor, these\\ncases are classified as preterm premature rupture of membranes (for discussion of diagnosis see\\nPremature Rupture of Membranes).\\nPreterm birth complicates approximately 12% of all pregnancies in the United States. It is the\\nnumber one cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality and causes 75% of neonatal deaths that are not\\ndue to congenital anomalies.\\nThirteen percent of all infants are classified as low birth weight (<2500 g), of whom 25% are\\nmature low-birth-weight infants and approximately 75% are truly premature. The latter group\\naccounts for nearly two-thirds of infant deaths (approximately 25,000 annually in the United States).\\nApproximately 30% of premature births are due to miscalculation of gestational age or to medical\\nintervention required by the mother or fetus.\\nThe care of premature infants is costly.

Once the patient is determined to not have any of these\\ncontraindications, the management of preterm labor depends on fetal gestational age. Generally,\\nmanagement falls into 1 of 2 categories: expectant management (observation) or intervention.

Furthermore, intervention carries significant risks to the mother, including the risks of\\nprolonged bed rest and side effects of tocolysis. Given these risks, expectant management is an\\nacceptable and, in certain instances, preferable alternative to intervention. Mothers who choose\\nintervention as opposed to expectant management should be extensively counseled by a\\nmultidisciplinary team, including the neonatologist, obstetrician, and social worker.\\nConversely, once a pregnancy has continued beyond 34–37 weeks’ EGA or EFW greater than 2500\\ng, the fetal survival rate is within 1% of the survival rate at 37 weeks. Fetal morbidity is less severe\\nand is rarely a cause of long-term sequelae. Furthermore, corticosteroids have not \\nbeen shown to be of\\nbenefit in fetuses of this age or size. Therefore, expectant management is usually the recommended\\ncourse of action. Several factors should be considered when deciding between intervention and\\nexpectant management, including the certainty of the patient’s dates, EFW, presence of maternal\\nproblems that could delay fetal lung maturity such as diabetes mellitus, and family history of late-\\nonset respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).\\nThere are other cases in which maternal or fetal factors indicate that preterm labor should be\\nallowed to continue regardless of gestational age. \\nTable 14–2\\n lists cases in detail.\\nThe following is a protocol for management of pregnancies with preterm labor between 24 and 34\\nweeks’ gestation.\\nA. Bed Rest\\nThe role of bed rest in the management of preterm labor is controversial. Meta-analyses have failed to\\ndemonstrate prolongation of pregnancy. Bed rest is associated with an increased risk of maternal\\nthromboembolism. At minimum, bed rest may be advised particularly during the initial evaluation of\\nan episode of preterm labor to allow for close fetal and maternal monitoring.\\nB. Corticosteroids\\nThe administration of corticosteroids to accelerate fetal lung maturity has become the standard of care\\nin the United States for all women between 24 and 34 weeks’ EGA at risk of preterm delivery within\\nthe following 7 days. It has been shown to decrease the incidence of neonatal respiratory distress,\\nintraventricular hemorrhage, and neonatal mortality. Steroids can be given according to 1 of 2\\nprotocols: (1) betamethasone 12 mg intramuscularly (IM) every 24 hours for a total of 2 doses; or (2)\\ndexamethasone 6 mg IM every 12 hours for a total of 4 doses.\\nThe optimal benefits of antenatal corticosteroids are seen 24 hours after administration, peak at 48\\nhours, and continue for at least 7 days. If therapy for preterm labor is successful and the pregnancy\\ncontinues beyond 2 weeks, there are data suggesting that a single repeat course of steroids may be\\nbeneficial if the risk of preterm birth remains high and the patient is <33 weeks. More than 2 courses,\\nhowever, may be associated with fetal growth abnormalities and delayed psychomotor development in\\nthe infant. In terms of safety of 1 or 2 courses of antenatal steroids, there does not appear to be an\\nincreased risk of infection or suppression of the fetal adrenal glands with steroid administration, and\\nlong-term follow-up of fetuses who received 1 or 2 courses of antenatal steroids shows no sequelae\\nthat can be attributed directly to steroid administration.\\nC. Tocolysis\\nIf the patient continues to contract and falls into a high-risk group based on a history of preterm birth,\\npositive fibronectin, short cervix on transvaginal sonography, or changing dilatation on cervical\\nexamination, tocolytic therapy may be initiated.

Beta-mimetic adrenergic agents\\n—Beta-mimetic adrenergic agents act directly on beta receptors\\n(β\\n2\\n) to relax the uterus. Their use is limited by dose-related cardiovascular side effects, including\\npulmonary edema, adult RDS, elevated systolic blood pressure and reduced diastolic blood pressure,\\nand both maternal and fetal tachycardia. Other dose-related effects are decreased serum potassium\\nlevel and increased blood glucose and plasma insulin levels and lactic acidosis. Maternal medical\\ncontraindications to the use of β-adrenergic agents include cardiac disease, hyperthyroidism,\\nuncontrolled hypertension or pulmonary hypertension, asthma requiring sympathomimetic drugs or\\ncorticosteroids for relief, uncontrolled diabetes, and chronic hepatic or renal disease. Commonly\\nobserved effects during intravenous administration are palpitations, tremors, nervousness, and\\nrestlessness. The beta-mimetic in common use is terbuta-line. Although it has been used in the past,\\nritodrine is no longer commercially available. Because of the side effects, beta-mimetic tocolysis in\\nthe United States is now limited almost exclusively to subcutaneous intermittent injections as a\\nmethod of temporizing and triaging patients before definitive therapy with other agents.\\nAlthough not approved by the FDA for use as a tocolytic, terbutaline has been studied in the United\\nStates and is used widely as a tocolytic agent. For tocolysis, it is administered via subcutaneous\\nboluses. Given the potential for maternal cardiac toxicity, terbutaline should only be used for a\\nmaximum of 48–72 hours and should only be used in an inpatient setting.\\n2. Magnesium sulfate\\n—Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, magnesium sulfate\\nappears to inhibit calcium uptake into smooth muscle cells, reducing uterine contractility. The\\nefficacy of magnesium is debated, but several small studies have shown an effect comparable to that\\nof beta-mimetics, and it may be better tolerated than beta-mimetics. Magnesium sulfate may appear\\nless likely to cause serious side effects than the beta-mimetics, but its therapeutic range is close to the\\nrange at which it will \\ncause respiratory and cardiac depression. Therefore, patients receiving\\nmagnesium sulfate should be monitored closely for signs of toxicity, with frequent checks of deep\\ntendon reflexes, pulmonary examinations, and strict calculations of the patient’s fluid balance. These\\neffects may be reversed by calcium gluconate (10 mL of a 10% solution given intravenously), and this\\nantidote should be kept at the bedside when magnesium sulfate is used.\\n3. Calcium channel blockers\\n—Calcium channel blockers such as nifedipine work as tocolytics by\\ninhibiting calcium uptake into uterine smooth muscle cells via voltage-dependent channels, thereby\\nreducing uterine contractility. Several studies have shown nifedipine to be equally or more efficacious\\nthan beta-mimetics in preterm labor. Other advantages are its low incidence of maternal side effects\\nand ease of administration. Nifedipine can be given by mouth. A common regimen for tocolysis is\\nnifedipine 20 mg by mouth, then 10–20 mg by mouth every 6 hours until contractions diminish\\nsufficiently.\\n4. Prostaglandin synthase inhibitors\\n—Prostaglandin synthase inhibitors such as indomethacin have\\nbeen shown to be as effective as ritodrine for tocolysis, but their use has been limited by potentially\\nserious fetal effects. Indomethacin works as a tocolytic by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, an\\nimportant mediator in uterine smooth muscle contractility. The advantages of indomethacin are its\\nease of administration (it can be given by rectum or by mouth) and its potent tocolytic activity.\\nHowever, it has been associated with oligohydramnios and premature closure of the ductus arteriosus.\\nIn preterm infants delivered before 30 weeks’ EGA, some studies have demonstrated an increased risk\\nof intracranial hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, and patent ductus \\narteriosus after birth. A\\ncommon regimen for tocolysis is indomethacin 100 mg per rectum loading dose (or 50 mg by mouth),\\nthen 25–50 mg by mouth or rectum every 4–6 hours. Ultrasound should be performed every 48–72'),\n",

Because of the potentially serious fetal effects, many centers\\nlimit its use to infants less than 32 weeks’ EGA and its duration of use to less than 48 hours.\\n5. Treatment with multiple tocolytics\\n—All tocolytics have significant failure rates; therefore, if 1\\ntocolytic appears to be failing, that agent should be stopped and another agent should be tried. The use\\nof multiple tocolytics at the same time appears to have an additive tocolytic effect, but also appears to\\nincrease the risk of serious side effects. For example, magnesium sulfate used in combination with\\nnifedipine theoretically can cause serious maternal hypotension. Likewise, magnesium sulfate\\nsupplemented by 1–2 doses of subcutaneous terbutaline may be safe and effective, but sustained\\ntreatment with the 2 can increase the patient’s risk of pulmonary edema. It should be remembered that\\nthe patient who is difficult to tocolyze may have an unrecognized chorioamnionitis or placental\\nabruption, conditions that may be contraindications to use of any tocolysis at all.\\n6. Results of tocolytic therapy\\n—With all tocolytics, a point may be reached where further therapy is\\nnot indicated. This may be due to adverse maternal or fetal response to the progress of labor. Thus, if\\ncervical dilatation reaches 5 cm, the treatment should be considered a failure and abandoned.\\nConversely, if labor resumes after a period of quiescence, treatment should be carefully considered\\nbecause the recrudescence of contractions may be a sign of intrauterine infection. In some cases,\\ntherapy may be reinstituted using the same or a different drug.\\nD. Antibiotics\\nAntibiotic therapy as a treatment of preterm labor and a means of prolonging pregnancy has been\\nstudied and has shown no benefit in delaying preterm birth in this population of patients. Patients with\\npreterm labor should be started on antibiotics for prevention of neonatal GBS infection if the patient’s\\nGBS status is positive or unknown. Penicillin or ampicillin is used as first-line agents; cefazolin,\\nclindamycin, erythromycin, or vancomycin can be used if the patient is allergic to penicillin. If the\\npatient is successfully tocolyzed and there is no sign of imminent delivery or if the patient’s most\\nrecent rectovaginal GBS culture (within 5 weeks) is negative, GBS prophylaxis can be discontinued.\\nE. Magnesium Sulfate for Fetal/Neonatal Neuroprotection\\nSeveral recent large trials have shown a reduced risk of cerebral palsy in fetuses exposed to\\nmagnesium sulfate in utero. The largest trial from the United States demonstrated a significant\\nreduction in moderate to severe cerebral palsy in children at or beyond 2 years of age who received\\nmagnesium sulfate immediately before delivery. The optimal candidates for magnesium for this\\nindication are not well defined, but it is reasonable to offer magnesium sulfate to any woman between\\n24 0/7 and 32 0/7 weeks of gestation immediately before delivery to reduce the risk of adverse\\nneurologic outcomes (\\nTable 14–4\\n).\\nTable 14–4\\n.

Conduct of Labor and Delivery\\nPremature infants younger than 34 weeks should be delivered in a hospital equipped for neonatal\\nintensive care whenever possible, because inter-hospital transfer after birth is more hazardous.\\nAlthough the route of delivery for very-low-birth-weight infants has been hotly debated, there is no\\nconclusive evidence of a benefit to routine caesarean delivery. Indications for caesarean are the usual\\nobstetrical indications, including nonreassuring fetal status, malpresentation, and history of prior\\ncaesarean.\\nIf caesarean delivery is indicated, the decision to operate is based on maturity of the fetus and\\nprognosis for survival. In borderline cases (23–24 weeks’ gestation and 500–600 g EFW), the wishes\\nof the parents with regard to intervention assume an important place.

Premature rupture of the\\nmembranes (PROM) is defined as rupture of membranes before the onset of active labor. It becomes a\\nparticular problem if the fetus is preterm (preterm premature rupture of membranes [PPROM]) or, in\\nthe case of a term fetus, if the period of time between rupture of the membranes and the onset of labor\\nis prolonged. If 24 hours elapse between rupture of the membranes and the onset of labor, the problem\\nis one of prolonged PROM.\\nThe exact cause of rupture is not known, although many conditions are associated with PROM\\n(\\nTable 14–6\\n). PROM occurs in approximately 10.7% of all pregnancies. In approximately 94% of\\ncases, this occurs at term or ≥37 weeks (approximately 20% of these are cases of prolonged rupture).\\nPreterm fetuses (<37 weeks) account for approximately 5% of the total number of cases of PROM.\\nTable 14–6\\n. Diseases and disorders associated with premature rupture of the membranes.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='The pathophysiology of PROM is poorly understood. Risk factors include decidual hemorrhage, a\\nhistory of spontaneous preterm birth in a prior pregnancy, bacterial colonization of the membranes,\\nand invasive procedures such as amniocentesis. PROM is an important cause of preterm labor,\\nprolapse of the cord, placental abruption, and intrauterine infection. Chorioamnionitis is an important\\nsequela of PROM and may precede endomyometritis or sepsis of the newborn.\\nIn extremely prolonged rupture of the membranes, the fetus may have an appearance similar to that\\nof Potter’s syndrome (ie, flattened facial features, wrinkling of the skin). If rupture of membranes\\nwith subsequent oligohydramnios occurs early in pregnancy at less than 26 weeks’ EGA, it can cause\\npulmonary hypoplasia and limb positioning defects in the newborn.\\nPrevention\\nAs with preterm labor, there are few interventions known to prevent PPROM. For women with a\\nhistory of a prior spontaneous preterm birth, there is evidence indicating that progestin administered\\nvia either vaginal suppositories of progesterone or weekly intramuscular injections of 17-α\\nhydroxyprogesterone caproate from 16 weeks until approximately 36–37 weeks reduces the risk of\\nrecurrent preterm birth by approximately 30%. Furthermore, vaginal progesterone may also reduce the\\nrisk of preterm birth in women found to have a short cervix on transvaginal ultrasound in the\\nmidtrimester. But, aside from these specific interventions, there is little we can do to prevent PPROM.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms\\nThe diagnostic evaluation must be efficient and impeccably conducted to minimize the number of\\nvaginal examinations and the risk of chorioamnionitis. Symptoms are the key to diagnosis; the patient\\nusually reports a sudden gush of fluid or continued leakage. Additional symptoms that may be useful\\ninclude the color and consistency of the fluid and the presence of flecks of vernix or meconium,\\nreduced size of the uterus, and increased prominence of the fetus to palpation.\\nB. Sterile Speculum Examination\\nA most important step in accurate diagnosis is examination with a sterile speculum. This examination'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='is the key to differentiating PROM from hydrorrhea gravidarum, vaginitis, increased vaginal\\nsecretions, and urinary incontinence. The examiner should look for the 3 hallmark confirmatory\\nfindings associated with PROM:\\n1. Pooling—the collection of amniotic fluid in the posterior fornix.\\n2. Nitrazine test—a sterile cotton-tipped swab should be used to collect fluid from the posterior\\nfornix and apply \\nit to Nitrazine (phenaphthazine) paper. In the presence of amniotic fluid, the\\nNitrazine paper turns blue, demonstrating an alkaline pH (7.0–7.25).\\n3. Ferning—Fluid from the posterior fornix is placed on a slide and allowed to air-dry. Amniotic\\nfluid will form a fernlike pattern of crystallization.\\nTogether, these 3 findings confirm ruptured membranes, although several factors may produce\\nfalse-positive results. Alkaline pH on Nitrazine test can also be caused by vaginal infections or the\\npresence of blood or semen in the sample. Cervical mucus can cause ferning, but usually patchy and\\nless extensive than with PROM. During the speculum examination, the patient’s cervix should be\\nvisually inspected to determine the degree of dilatation and effacement and the presence of cord\\nprolapse. If vaginal pool is significant, the pool can be collected and sent for fetal lung maturity\\ndetermination if the gestational age is greater than 32 weeks. Cervical secretions should also be sent\\nfor culture, and a wet mount should be performed.\\nIf no free fluid is found, a dry pad should be placed under the patient’s perineum and observed for\\nleakage. Other confirmatory tests for PROM include observed loss of fluid from the cervical os when\\nthe patient coughs or performs a Valsalva maneuver during speculum examination and\\noligohydramnios on ultrasound examination. If the examiner still cannot confirm rupture of\\nmembranes and the patient’s history is highly suspicious for PROM, it may be necessary to perform\\namniocentesis and inject a dilute solution of indigo carmine dye. This can be done after removal of\\namniotic fluid for pulmonary maturity testing, analysis for evidence of subacute intra-amniotic\\ninfection, and possible culture and sensitivity testing. After 15–30 minutes, examination of the\\npatient’s perineal pad will reveal blue dye if the membranes are ruptured.\\nC. Physical Examination\\nOnce PROM is confirmed, a careful physical examination is necessary to search for other signs of\\ninfection. Given the risk of infection, there is no indication for digital cervical examination if the\\npatient is in early labor. The sterile speculum examination is sufficient to distinguish between early\\nand advanced labor.\\nD. Laboratory Studies\\nInitial laboratory studies should include a complete blood count with differential. In preterm\\npregnancies, evaluation should also include urine collected by catheterization for urinalysis, culture,\\nand sensitivity testing and ultrasound examination for fetal size and amniotic fluid index. For patients\\nbetween 32 and 34 weeks, a specimen of amniotic fluid collected from the vaginal pool or via\\namniocentesis can be sent for fetal lung maturity studies. Furthermore, many centers perform\\namniocentesis in all women with PPROM before 34 weeks to test for evidence of intra-amniotic\\ninfection.\\nE.

Chorioamnionitis\\nIf chorioamnionitis is present in the patient with PROM, the patient should be actively delivered\\nregardless of gestational age\\n. Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be started to treat the\\nchorioamnionitis. If the patient is not in labor, labor should be induced to expedite delivery.

Term Pregnancy Without Chorioamnionitis\\nThe term pregnancy (EGA ≥37 weeks) with PROM in the absence of infection can be managed\\nexpectantly or actively. One large study found that starting induction of labor at presentation as\\nopposed to expectant management reduced the time interval between PROM and delivery and the\\nfrequency of chorioamnionitis and postpartum febrile morbidity and neonatal antibiotic treatment.\\nTherefore, active management with induction of labor at time of presentation for the woman with\\nPROM at term is the preferred management strategy.\\nC.

Most fetuses will\\nshow effects of impaired nutritional supply (weight loss, reduced subcutaneous tissue, scaling,\\nparchment-like skin). This condition is referred to as dysmaturity. The most common cause of\\nprolonged pregnancy is incorrect dating due to variable length of the menstrual cycle. This has been\\nreduced in recent years with widespread use of first-trimester ultrasound for dating. The cause of most\\ncases of true prolonged pregnancy remains unknown. Experiments of nature, such as anencephalic\\nfetuses and those with placental sulfatase deficiency, suggest that changes in placental steroid\\nmetabolism due to fetal hormonal signaling play a central role in the timing of delivery. At least 3%\\nof infants are born after 42 completed weeks’ gestation (in some series, as many as 12%). Because of\\nthe potential risks of dysmaturity, these infants deserve particular attention.\\nThe maternal risks usually relate to large fetal size (ie, dysfunctional labor, arrested progress of'),\n",

Large fetal size may result in birth injury (eg, shoulder dystocia).\\nPlacental insufficiency is thought to be associated with aging of the placenta and is the basis for\\nanother group of fetal problems. Oligohydramnios, which is more common in postterm gestation, may\\nlead to cord compromise.\\nComplications resulting from prolonged pregnancy result in a sharp rise in perinatal mortality and\\nmorbidity rates (2–3 times those of infants born at 37–42 weeks). Complications in the survivors\\nincrease the chance of neurologic sequelae.\\nPrevention\\nThe most common cause of an apparent postterm pregnancy is an error in pregnancy dating. First-\\ntrimester ultrasound is an accurate way to confirm a patient’s estimated date of delivery and has been\\nshown to reduce the incidence of pregnancies diagnosed as postterm.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe diagnosis of prolonged pregnancy is made by confirmation of the gestational age by referring to\\nrecords of early pregnancy tests and ultrasound examinations, the exact time of conception (if known),\\nand clinical parameters (eg, LMP, quickening, detection of fetal heart tones).\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe most likely differential diagnosis of the suspected post-term pregnancy is incorrect pregnancy\\ndating, which may be determined via a careful review of the patient’s dating criteria. However, it may\\nbe difficult to ascertain the correct due date in a patient who presents for prenatal care late in\\npregnancy or has not had any early ultrasounds in pregnancy.\\nTreatment\\nThe principal risk of labor induction has been thought to be an increased rate of caesarean birth. It has\\nnow been conclusively demonstrated, however, that induction of labor at 41 weeks does not increase\\nthe caesarean rate compared with expectant management with antepartum testing. Therefore, many\\nauthorities offer induction of labor at 41 completed weeks, reserving expectant management for those\\npatients who refuse induction.\\nTo adequately assess the risk of fetal compromise, the following is a useful protocol for\\npregnancies beyond 41 weeks’ gestation:\\n1. Some form of fetal surveillance is advised, either with nonstress testing and measurement of\\namniotic fluid volume twice per week or with biophysical profiles twice per week.\\n2. Perform ultrasonic monitoring at least twice weekly to assess amniotic fluid volume (biophysical\\nprofiles may be obtained at the same time).\\n3.

A woman who is lacking Rh(D) (otherwise\\nknown as Rh-negative) may carry an Rh-positive fetus if the fetus inherited the D antigen from the\\nfather. If fetal red blood cells pass into the mother’s circulation in sufficient numbers, maternal IgG\\nantibodies to the D antigen may develop and cross the placenta, causing hemolysis of fetal blood cells\\n(\\nFig. 14–1\\n).

Maternal Rh Alloimmunization\\nRh alloimmunization generally occurs by 1 of 2 mechanisms: (1) after incompatible blood transfusion\\nor (2) after fetomaternal hemorrhage between a mother and an incompatible fetus. Fetomaternal\\nhemorrhage may occur during pregnancy or at delivery. With no apparent predisposing factors, fetal\\nred cells have been detected in maternal blood in 6.7% of women during the first trimester, 15.9%\\nduring the second trimester, and 28.9% during the third trimester.

A very important factor is\\nthat approximately 30% of Rh-negative persons never become sensitized (non-responders) when given\\nRh-positive blood. ABO incompatibility also confers a protective effect (see Incidence).\\nThe initial maternal immune response to Rh sensitization is low levels of immunoglobulin (Ig) M.\\nWithin 6 weeks to 6 months, IgG antibodies become detectable. In contrast to IgM, IgG is capable of\\ncrossing the placenta and destroying fetal Rh-positive cells.\\nB. Other Blood Group Alloimmunization\\nOf the other blood groups that may evoke an immunoglobulin capable of crossing the placenta (often\\ncalled atypical or irregular immunizing antibodies), those that may cause severe fetal hemolysis\\n(listed in descending order of occurrence) are Kell, Duffy, Kidd, MNSs, and Diego. P, Lutheran, and\\nXg groups may also cause fetal hemolysis, but it usually is less severe.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of Rh (D) alloimmunization is possible by identifying women known to be negative for the\\nRh (D) antigen and administering anti-D immunoglobulin to prevent sensitization.\\nA.

Postpartum\\nIf the infant is Rh(D)-positive, 300 μg of RhIgG is administered to the mother (provided maternal\\nantibody screening is negative). Although RhIgG should generally be given within 72 hours after\\ndelivery, it has been shown to be effective in preventing alloimmunization if given up to 28 days after\\ndelivery. If the antibody screen is positive, the patient is managed as if she will be Rh-sensitized\\nduring the next pregnancy.\\nE. Special Fetomaternal Risk States\\nSeveral circumstances may occur during pregnancy that mandate administration of RhIgG to the\\nunsensitized patient outside the management protocol described.\\n1. Abortion\\n—Sensitization will occur in 2% of spontaneous abortions and 4–5% of induced abortions.\\nIn the first trimester, because of the small amount of fetal blood, 50 μg of RhIgG apparently is\\nsufficient to prevent sensitization. However, because the cost of RhIgG has dropped, a full 300-μg\\ndose is usually given. The same dose is recommended for exposure after the first trimester. The risk of\\nRh alloimmunization after threatened abortion is less well understood, but many experts agree that\\nRhIgG should also be given to these patients.\\n2. Amniocentesis, Chorionic Villus Sampling, and Cord Blood Sampling\\n—If the placenta is\\ntraversed by the needle, there is up to an 11% chance of sensitization. Therefore, administration of\\n300 μg of RhIgG is recommended when these procedures are performed in the unsensitized patient.\\n3. Antepartum Bleeding\\n—In cases of antepartum vaginal bleeding or when there is evidence of a\\nsubchorionic hematoma or placenta abruption on ultrasound, administration of 300 μg of RhIgG is\\nrecommended. If the pregnancy is carried more than 12 weeks from the time of RhIgG administration,\\na repeat prophylactic dose is recommended.\\n4. External cephalic version\\n—Fetomaternal hemorrhage occurs in 2–6% of patients who undergo\\nexternal cephalic version, whether failed or successful; therefore, these patients should receive 300 μg\\nof RhIgG.\\nF. Delivery With Fetomaternal Hemorrhage\\nFetomaternal hemorrhage so extensive that it cannot be managed with 300 μg of RhIgG occurs in only\\napproximately 0.4% of patients. The amount of hemorrhage can be quantified by the Kleihauer-Bethke\\ntest and additional doses of RhIgG given according to the amount of fetomaternal hemorrhage.\\nClinical Findings\\nHemolytic disease of the newborn occurs when the maternal antibodies cross the placenta and destroy\\nthe Rh-positive fetal red blood cells. Fetal anemia results, stimulating extramedullary erythropoietic\\nsites to produce high levels of nucleated red cell elements. Immature erythrocytes are present in the\\nfetal blood because of poor maturation control. Hemolysis produces heme, which is converted to\\nbilirubin; both of these substances are neurotoxic. However, although the fetus is in utero, heme and\\nbilirubin are effectively removed by the placenta and metabolized by the mother.\\nWhen fetal red blood cell destruction far exceeds production and severe anemia occurs,\\nerythroblastosis fetalis may result. This is characterized by extramedullary hematopoiesis, heart\\nfailure, edema, ascites, and pericardial effusion. Tissue hypoxia and acidosis may result. Normal\\nhepatic architecture and function may be disturbed by extensive liver erythropoiesis, which may lead'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='to decreased protein production, portal hypertension, and ascites. On ultrasound, fetal hydrops may be\\nvisualized, which is defined as the presence of any 2 of the following: pleural effusion, ascites,\\npericardial effusion, increased skin thickness, polyhydramnios, or increased placental thickness.\\nIn the immediate neonatal interval, the primary problem may relate to anemia and the sequelae\\nmentioned previously. However, hyperbilirubinemia may also pose an immediate risk and certainly\\nposes a risk as further red cell breakdown occurs. The immature (and often compromised) liver, with\\nits low levels of glucuronyl transferase, is unable to conjugate the large amounts of bilirubin. This\\nresults in a high serum bilirubin level, with resultant kernicterus (bilirubin deposition in the basal\\nganglia).\\nTreatment\\nA. Management of the Unsensitized Rh-Negative Patient\\nManagement of the pregnancy complicated by alloimmunization is guided by 2 factors: whether the\\npatient has a history of an affected fetus in a previous pregnancy (ie, fetus with severe anemia or\\nhydrops) and maternal antibody titers.\\n1. No history of previous fetus affected by rh alloimmunization\\n—Once the antibody screen is\\npositive for alloimmunization, these patients should be followed up \\nwith antibody titers at intake, 20\\nweeks’ EGA, and then every 2–4 weeks. As long as antibody titers remain below the critical titer\\n(<1:32 in our laboratory, but each laboratory must establish its own norms), there is no indication for\\nfurther intervention. Once antibody titers reach 1:32, additional surveillance should be performed\\nbecause a titer of 1:32 places the fetus at significant risk of hydrops and demise before 37 weeks.\\nUltrasound assessment of blood flow in the fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) by Doppler has been\\nshown to be a reliable and noninvasive screening tool for detecting moderate to severe fetal anemia. It\\nis based on the concept that the fetus preserves oxygen delivery to the brain in the setting of anemia\\nby increasing flow to the brain of the low viscosity blood. Ultrasound is performed to identify the\\ncircle of Willis, and blood flow in the proximal third of the MCA can be estimated using Doppler.\\nHigh peak velocity blood flow in this area (>1.5 multiples of the median) correlates well with severe\\nfetal anemia. This test can be performed at 2-week intervals in these patients, so more invasive\\ndiagnostic interventions can be avoided until evidence of severe anemia is observed.\\nIn the past, amniocentesis has been used to determine amniotic fluid bilirubin levels and identify\\nfetuses at risk of severe anemia; however, given the invasive nature of repeated amniocenteses,\\nultrasound for MCA Dopplers has widely replaced amniocentesis for this indication.\\n2. History of a prior fetus affected by rh alloimmunization\\n—Antibody titers need not be followed\\nin these pregnancies because amniocentesis is indicated by the history of prior affected fetus.\\nAmniocentesis may be performed to determine the fetal genotype if the father of the fetus is\\ndetermined to be heterozygous for D. If the fetus is determined to have the D antigen, that fetus is\\nconsidered to be at risk of hemolytic disease and severe anemia regardless of maternal antibody titers.\\nIn general, after a first affected pregnancy, future pregnancies tend to manifest with more severe\\ndisease and at an earlier gestational age. For this reason, MCA Doppler surveillance should be\\ninitiated at 18 weeks and repeated every 1–2 weeks. Treatment of these patients is dictated by MCA\\nDoppler.\\n3. Results of MCA Dopplers\\n—Once it is determined that a patient should be followed with MCA\\nDopplers, the results of the MCA Dopplers will place the fetus into one of three categories:'),\n",

M\\nODERATELY AFFECTED FETUS\\n—The fetus that has MCA Doppler studies nearing 1.5 multiples of\\nthe median should be tested more frequently, every 1–2 weeks.

S\\nEVERELY AFFECTED FETUS\\n—The severely affected fetus has MCA Doppler studies >1.55 multiples\\nof the median or has frank evidence of hydrops (eg, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion,\\nsubcutaneous edema).

Intrauterine transfusions are\\ngenerally performed between 18 and 35 weeks of gestation. Before 18 weeks, access to the umbilical\\nvein is limited due to the small caliber of the vessel. After 35 weeks, the risk/benefit ratio favors\\ndelivery of a fetus with evidence of severe anemia. Once severe anemia is confirmed, intrauterine\\ntransfusion can be performed directly into the umbilical vein. The transfusion is performed using O-\\nnegative, cytomegalovirus-negative, washed, leukocyte-depleted, irradiated packed red cells. The\\nintraperitoneal technique was used in years past but has largely been replaced by intravascular fetal\\ntransfusion secondary to its more predictable absorption.\\nAfter transfusion, repeat transfusions or delivery usually will be necessary, as production of fetal\\nblood markedly decreases or ceases.

However, more recent\\ndata suggest that a nuchal cord is found in approximately 30% of normal births and is most likely an\\nincidental finding when a stillbirth is diagnosed.

Evaluation\\nUltrasound examination should be performed to confirm the fetal demise and the gestational age and\\nto evaluate for any signs of fetal abnormality. Further testing can be divided into maternal and fetal\\ntesting (\\nTable 14–9\\n). The role of investigation for maternal inherited thrombophilia is controversial.\\nTesting for maternal inherited thrombophilia should be considered if the fetus is severely growth\\nrestricted, if there is evidence of thrombosis on placental pathology, or if there is a personal or family\\nhistory of deepvenous thrombosis. Maternal toxicology screen should be considered if there is a\\nsuspicion for maternal drug abuse. Testing for diabetes should be performed if the patient was not\\nscreened during the pregnancy or if the fetus is large for gestational age.

The infection is caused by a single-stranded DNA virus, the B19 parvovirus, which is\\ntransmitted through respiratory secretions and hand-to-mouth contact. The virus has a predilection for\\nrapidly dividing cells such as erythroid progenitor cells.\\nPrevalence of seropositivity increases with age, and about 50–60% of reproductive-aged women\\nhave documented antibodies to parvovirus B19 consistent with prior infection. Immunity is considered\\nlifelong, although reinfection has been documented. The incidence of acute parvovirus infection\\nduring pregnancy is 3.3–3.8%. Schoolteachers, day care workers, and homemakers are most\\nsusceptible. Nonimmune individuals exposed in a classroom have a 20–30% risk of infection. The\\nsecondary attack rate for household members is up to 50%.\\nDuring pregnancy, the virus can cross the placenta and infect red cell progenitors in the fetal bone\\nmarrow. The virus suppresses erythropoiesis by attaching to the “P” antigen on red cell stem cells.\\nThis results in severe anemia and high-output congestive heart failure. In addition to the reduced\\nsurvival of fetal red blood cells, anemia is further complicated by the increased demands of an\\nexpanding intravascular volume and the inability of the immature immune system to control the\\ninfection. Additionally, the virus can attack fetal myocardiocytes via the same “P” antigen and cause a\\ncardiomyopathy, further exacerbating the congestive heart failure.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Prevention\\nPregnant women who are susceptible to parvovirus B19 should avoid contact with known infected\\nindividuals.

Additionally, those with\\ninfection are infectious prior to the onset of symptoms. Therefore, a policy to routinely remove\\nwomen from occupations considered high risk, such as day care attendants, is not recommended. On\\nthe other hand, patients should be counseled on careful hand washing and avoidance of sharing food\\nand drink.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms & Signs (\\nTable 15–1\\n)\\nParvovirus B19 causes the common childhood illness erythema infectiosum (also known as “fifth\\ndisease”). Erythema infectiosum is characterized by a low-grade fever, malaise, arthralgias, and a\\n“slapped cheek” facial rash. Patients may also present with a “lace-like” erythematous rash on the\\ntrunk and extremities. The incubation period for parvovirus is 10–20 days. Although the typical rashes\\nare more common \\nin children, adults may also present with dermatologic manifestations.\\nTable 15–1\\n. Clinical manifestations of parvovirus.\\nSystemic symptoms are noted 1–4 days prior to the onset of the rash. These symptoms include\\nfever, malaise, and arthropathy, which is more common in adults. Patients with hemoglobinopathies\\nsuch as sickle cell anemia are at risk for aplastic crises, which are usually self-limited. Patients\\ninfected with this virus are considered infectious 5–10 days following exposure up to the onset of\\nsymptoms. Once the rash presents, individuals are no longer infectious.\\nB. Laboratory Findings\\nSerologic testing is used to diagnose maternal parvovirus infection. Immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody\\ncapture radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are commonly used,\\nwith sensitivities ranging from 80–90%. There are various possible combinations of serologic test\\nresults that indicate varying disease states (\\nTable 15–2\\n). IgM antibodies are detected 7–10 days after\\nexposure, peak at 10–14 days, and remain positive for several months. Indicating prior infection, IgG\\nantibodies present several days after IgM, plateau at 4 weeks, and persist for many years. When both\\nIgM and IgG are positive, establishing the exact timing of infection is difficult.'),\n",

The\\nmedian interval between diagnosis of maternal infection and hydrops is 3 weeks. Fifty percent of\\ncases occur within 2–5 weeks of maternal infection, and 93% of fetal manifestations occur within 8\\nweeks. The risk of anemia with hydrops depends on the gestational age at which maternal infection\\noccurs. If infection occurs during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, the risk of hydrops is 5–10%. This\\nrisk decreases to less than 5% if infection develops during weeks 13–20. After week 20 of gestation,\\nthe risk of hydrops is less than 1%. Hydropic fetuses with parvovirus are also at risk for severe\\nthrombocytopenia.

If severe anemia is suspected based on\\nelevated Doppler middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity or signs of hydrops, the fetal\\nhematocrit should be assessed by percutaneous umbilical vein sampling (cordocentesis). Confirmed\\nfetal anemia should be treated with intrauterine blood transfusion. The fetal platelet count should also\\nbe determined because the fetus is at risk for thrombocytopenia. Platelets should be available at the\\ntime of transfusion. Although there is a risk of fetal death after periumbilical blood sampling,\\nmultiple retrospective studies have demonstrated the benefit of such a procedure in hydropic fetuses\\nwith parvovirus infection.

Although a majority of infections occur in\\nchildren, 2% of cases occur in adults. In children, the infection is often benign and self-limited,\\nwhereas in adults, it can be devastating. Adults over the age of 20 contribute to over half of varicella-\\nrelated deaths.\\nThe virus is transmitted by respiratory droplets and direct contact with vesicular lesions. Once\\ndroplets enter conjunctiva or nasal/oral mucosa, the virus replicates in regional lymph nodes and\\nspreads to internal organs. Secondary viremia occurs as the virus is released into the bloodstream and\\nattacks cutaneous tissue leading to VZV exanthem. Infectivity is present from 1–2 days prior to the\\nonset of the rash up until the lesions crust over. VZV is highly infectious, with secondary attack rates\\napproximating 90% in susceptible household contacts.\\nFollowing a primary VZV infection, the virus remains dormant in dorsal root ganglia. In the setting\\nof impaired immunity, the virus may be reactivated to cause herpes zoster, a vesicular erythematous\\nskin rash that presents along dermatomes. Although there are isolated case reports of reinfection,\\nprimary VZV is associated with lifelong immunity.\\nPrevention'),\n",

Commonly referred to as the German measles,\\nthe virus is transmitted via respiratory droplets. From the respiratory tract, the virus replicates in\\nlymph nodes and hematogenously disseminates throughout the body. Hematogenous spread of the\\nvirus across the placenta leads to fetal infection or congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The virus\\ncauses cytopathic damage to vessels and ischemia in affected organs, leading to the various congenital\\ndefects.\\nPrevention\\nPrimary prevention of rubella is possible through preconceptional vaccination. Since the introduction\\nof the vaccine in 1969, the incidence of rubella in the United States has declined dramatically—from\\n0.45 per 100,000 in 1990 to 0.1 per 100,000 in 1999. The rubella vaccine consists of a live attenuated\\nvirus. Currently, the vaccine is recommended for all children from age 12–15 months and 4–6 years in\\nconjunction with measles and mumps (MMR vaccine). Although it is recommended that women\\nreceiving the rubella vaccine delay conception for at least 1 month, there are no data to suggest an\\nincrease in complications if inadvertently given during pregnancy.\\nReproductive-age women should be tested for immunity to rubella prior to pregnancy. If results\\nindicate susceptibility, these patients should be vaccinated prior to conception. If patients are not seen\\nbefore conception and instead present at the time of pregnancy, obstetricians should test for rubella at\\nthe first prenatal appointment. Susceptible women are counseled to avoid exposure to individuals with\\nviral exanthems.\\nPregnant women who are rubella nonimmune should be vaccinated immediately after delivery.\\nNinety-five percent of individuals receiving the vaccine will seroconvert. Vaccinated women can\\ncontinue breastfeeding and will not transmit the virus to susceptible contacts. Postpartum vaccination\\nprograms have been shown to reduce rubella susceptibility in pregnant nonimmune women. A study in\\n2004 revealed that one-third of pregnant women are also susceptible to mumps. Therefore, the Centers\\nfor Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that rubella-susceptible women receive the\\nMMR vaccine postpartum.\\nClinical Findings'),\n",

It has\\nthe ability to establish lifelong latency in the host after primary infection and can periodically\\nreactivate with shedding of virus. CMV is the most common congenital infection. Birth prevalence\\nestimates range from 0.2–2.5%.\\nHorizontal transmission of CMV results from transplantation of infected organs, blood\\ntransfusions, sexual contact, or contact with contaminated saliva or urine. Vertical transmission is due\\nto transplacental infection, ingestion of genital tract secretions during delivery, or breastfeeding.\\nBecause the virus has the potential to remain latent in host cells after resolution of initial infection,\\nCMV infections in pregnant women are either primary or recurrent. If the initial infection occurs\\nduring pregnancy, it is considered a primary infection. A recurrent infection refers to an infection in\\nwhich maternal CMV antibodies are present prior to conception.\\nCMV seropositivity increases with age. In the United States, approximately 50–80% of adult\\nwomen have serologic evidence of prior CMV infection. Although maternal \\npre-existing immunity\\ndecreases the risk of intrauterine transmission, the presence of antibodies is not absolutely protective\\nagainst either reinfection or vertical transmission. The rate of seroconversion in pregnancy is about 1–\\n4%.\\nHematogenous spread of the virus across the placenta is responsible for congenital infection.\\nDissemination is more likely during primary infection. In the case of primary infection in pregnancy,\\nthere is a 50% risk of fetal infection. The rate of transmission increases as the pregnancy progresses,\\nwith the highest risk of transmission in the third trimester. However, the severity of fetal injury is\\ngreatest if maternal primary infection occurs in the first trimester. In the setting of recurrent infection,\\nthe risk of fetal transmission is overall lower, with a 5–10% risk.\\nPrevention\\nThere is no vaccine to prevent CMV infection, and there is a lack of data to suggest that treatment of\\nmaternal infection prevents the risk of congenital CMV infection. For these reasons, routine prenatal\\nscreening for CMV is not recommended. Preventive measures, such as careful handwashing\\ntechniques, should be employed to decrease the risk of CMV infection during pregnancy. Susceptible\\nindividuals should avoid sharing food or drinks with young children. Seronegative pregnant women\\nshould also be transfused with CMV-negative blood products and counseled regarding safe sexual\\npractices if not in a monogamous relationship.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms & Signs (\\nTable 15–8\\n)\\nClinical manifestations of CMV depend on the integrity of the host immune system.\\nImmunocompromised individuals are at risk for severe infection and may present with complications\\nsuch as myocarditis, hepatitis, pneumonitis, retinitis, and/or meningoencephalitis. In pregnant women,\\nCMV infections are either subclinical or consist of mild nonspecific symptoms. Fever, flu-like\\nsymptoms, or mild hepatitis are more likely to occur in individuals with primary infections rather than\\nreinfection or reactivation.

Laboratory Findings\\nMaternal infection during pregnancy is diagnosed by serologic testing. Primary infection is confirmed\\nin the setting of seroconversion of CMV-specific IgG in paired acute and convalescent sera. Serum\\nsamples are collected 3–4 weeks apart and tested in parallel for anti-CMV IgG. Seroconversion from\\nnegative to positive or a significant increase in anti-CMV IgG titers is consistent with infection. IgM\\ntiters are not reliable in diagnosing CMV because the sensitivity of CMV IgM assays ranges from 50–\\n90%. Additionally, IgM titers can remain positive for more than a year and revert from negative to\\npositive in women with reactivation or reinfection with a different strain. Positive IgM titers decline\\nover a period of 30–60 days. When CMV-specific IgG and IgM are both positive, CMV IgG avidity\\ntesting can be performed to confirm primary CMV infection. A low-avidity CMV IgG test is\\nsuggestive of CMV infection occurring in the preceding 6 months. Alternatively, a high-avidity test\\nvirtually excludes the possibility of a primary CMV infection occurring within the previous 4 months.\\nAvidity testing is performed in the United States by Focus Diagnostics, a reference laboratory in\\nCalifornia. \\nFigure 15–5\\n depicts a management strategy for suspected maternal CMV infection.'),\n",

The\\nhighest concentrations of virus are found in urine, seminal fluid, saliva, and breast milk. Although\\nviral cultures can be positive within 72–96 hours, a minimum of 21 days is required before the culture\\nis reported as negative.\\nThe preferred method for diagnosing congenital CMV is via PCR identification of CMV in\\namniotic fluid. Sensitivities of PCR range from 70–100%. Data suggest that sensitivities are higher if\\nthe testing is performed after 21 weeks’ gestation and after a 6-week lag time between maternal\\ninfection and the procedure. This period allows sufficient time for the virus to infect the placenta and\\nfetus with subsequent replication of the virus in the fetal kidney followed by excretion into the\\namniotic fluid.

Wild and domestic cats are the only known host for the oocyst. The oocyst is formed in\\nthe intestine and then shed in cat feces. The oocysts become infective 1–5 days later and may remain\\ninfectious for over a year. Other animals, such as cows, \\ningest the oocyst. The oocyst then becomes\\nthe invasive trophozoite, which then spreads throughout the body forming cysts in brain and muscle.\\nIn developed countries, the prevalence of infection has declined over the last 30 years.

Anti-\\nToxoplasma\\n antibody can\\nbe detected using indirect fluorescent antibodies, indirect hemagglutination and agglutination tests,\\nand ELISA. IgM-specific antibodies suggest acute infection. Diagnosis of an infection during\\npregnancy is most precise when 2 blood samples, greater than 2 weeks apart, document\\nseroconversion from negative to positive \\nToxoplasma\\n-specific IgM or IgG. In certain parts of Europe,\\nwomen undergo serial testing with the goal of detecting early infection. However, the benefit of\\nroutine testing is controversial given the lack of data suggesting that treatment improves clinical\\noutcomes. In the United States, diagnosis of a recent \\nToxoplasma\\n infection is challenging in the\\nsetting of a single sample. IgM can remain positive for 10–13 months, and there is substantial\\nvariation among individuals. Twenty-five percent of women will have persistently positive IgM\\nlasting years, and in certain patients, low IgG avidity will also remain positive for years. Rising IgG\\ntiters are also not useful due to the variation among laboratories. In the setting of a positive IgM and a\\nnegative IgG result with both tests positive 2 weeks later, recent infection is likely.'),\n",

It is a facultative intracellular parasite that primarily inhabits soil\\nand decaying vegetative matter. Animals carrying the organism contaminate foods of animal origin\\nsuch as meat and dairy products. Although there are multiple species of \\nListeria, L monocytogenes\\n is\\nthe only species that is considered pathogenic in humans. The organism’s virulence is attributed to\\nlisteriolysin O, a pore-forming toxin, that enables the pathogen to suppress antigen-induced T-cell\\nactivation. Most \\nListeria\\n infections in adults are due to oral ingestion followed by intestinal mucosal\\npenetration and subsequent systemic infection.\\nAnnually, there are approximately 1600 cases of listeriosis in the United States, with a 16%\\nmortality rate. About 1 in 6 cases of listeriosis occurs during pregnancy. Recent data show that the\\noverall incidence of listeriosis is decreasing, with a 26% decrease noted by the CDC from 1998 to\\n2009. Human listeriosis can occur as either a sporadic illness or an epidemic. The sporadic form\\noccurs more commonly than the epidemic form (responsible for >95% of cases). \\nThe epidemic form is\\ndue to widespread contamination of food products. High-risk foods include unpasteurized soft\\ncheeses, processed/delicatessen meats, hot dogs, smoked seafood, and pâtés. Several outbreaks of\\nlisteriosis in the United States have been associated with Mexican-style soft cheeses made from\\nunpasteurized milk.\\nAlthough \\nL monocytogenes\\n can be isolated from the feces of 1–5% of healthy adults, systemic\\ninfections usually occur in individuals with predisposing conditions such as pregnancy, old age, and\\nimmunocompromised states. Decreased cell-mediated immunity in pregnancy is believed to be the\\ncause of increased susceptibility of pregnant women to listeriosis. Subsequent fetal and/or neonatal\\ninfection most likely occurs from hematogenous dissemination of the organism through the placenta,\\nalthough ascending infection from cervical colonization with \\nL monocytogenes\\n may also play a role.'),\n",

Symptoms & Signs\\nIn immunocompromised, elderly, and pregnant patients, \\nListeria\\n can lead to invasive disease, such as\\nmeningitis and sepsis. In healthy adults, if ingested in high numbers, the organism can cause febrile\\ngastroenteritis. The incubation period for \\nListeria\\n is generally 6–90 days, but may be only 24 hours\\nduring widespread epidemics of gastroenteritis.\\nListeriosis in pregnancy is most common in the third trimester. Although many pregnant infected\\nwomen are asymptomatic, about two-thirds manifest nonspecific flulike symptoms characterized by\\nfever, chills, myalgias, malaise, and upper respiratory complaints. Infection is usually mild and self-\\nlimited, but pregnant women may present with signs and symptoms of sepsis. Listerial CNS infection\\nin pregnancy is generally rare. Maternal listeriosis can lead to serious consequences such as fetal\\ndeath, premature delivery, and neonatal infection.\\nB. Laboratory Findings\\nThere are no specific clinical manifestations that help distinguish listeriosis from other infections that\\nmanifest with fever and nonspecific flu-like symptoms. Therefore, blood cultures are necessary in\\nestablishing the diagnosis. Routine cerebrospinal fluid analysis is limited because pregnant women do\\nnot usually present with CNS infections. Although routine stool cultures are not helpful in diagnosing\\nsystemic listeriosis, stool cultures using selective media may be valuable in patients with \\nListeria\\ngastroenteritis.

Eighty-four percent of these infants are IUGR. Ultrasound evaluation\\nmay reveal associated anomalies. The condition is associated with an increased likelihood of breech\\npresentation, polyhydramnios, fetal neural tube defects, and visceral anomalies. The average\\nbirthweight of infants with trisomy 18 is almost 1000 g less than that of controls.

Congenital infections\\n—(See also \\nChapter 15\\n, Congenital Fetal Infections, for more discussion.)\\nChronic intrauterine infection is responsible for 5–10% of IUGR pregnancies (\\nTable 16–3\\n). The most\\ncommonly identified pathogen is cytomegalovirus (CMV). Although CMV can be isolated from 0.5 to\\n2% of all newborns in the United States, clinically obvious infection at the time of birth affects only\\n0.2–2 in 1000 live births. Active fetoplacental infection is characterized by cytolysis, followed by\\nsecondary inflammation, fibrosis, and calcification. Only infants with clinically apparent infection at\\nbirth are likely to be IUGR. Signs of congenital infection are nonspecific but include central nervous\\nsystem involvement (eg, microcephaly), chorioretinitis, intracranial (periventricular) calcifications,\\npneumonitis, hepatosplenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia.\\nCongenital rubella infection increases the risk of IUGR. Infection in the first trimester results in\\nthe most severely affected fetuses, primarily as a result of microvascular endothelial damage. Such\\ninfants are likely to have structural cardiovascular and central nervous system defects such as\\nmicrocephaly, deafness, glaucoma, and cataracts.\\nOther viruses implicated in causing IUGR are herpesvirus, varicella-zoster virus, influenza virus,\\nand poliovirus, but the number of such cases is small. As expected by virtue of their chronic, indolent\\nnature, protozoan infections are associated with IUGR. The most common protozoan, \\nToxoplasma\\ngondii\\n, usually is acquired by ingestion of raw meat. Only women with a primary infection are at risk\\nfor having an affected infant. The average incidence is 1 in 1000 live births in the United States, but\\nthe incidence varies widely among locations and social populations. Approximately 20% of newborns\\nwith congenital toxoplasmosis will have IUGR. Malaria is another protozoan infection associated with\\nIUGR.\\nAlthough bacterial infections occur commonly in pregnancy and frequently are implicated in\\npremature delivery, they are not commonly associated with IUGR. Chronic infection from \\nListeria\\nmonocytogenes\\n is an exception. Infants usually are critically ill at the time of delivery and often have\\nencephalitis, pneumonitis, myocarditis, hepatosplenomegaly, jaundice, and petechiae.\\n3. Placental factors\\n—The placenta plays an important role in normal fetal growth. Placental weight\\nhas shown to be less with IUGR fetuses than with AGA fetuses, suggesting that appropriate fetal\\ngrowth may depend on the size or weight of the placenta. Several placental abnormalities are\\nassociated with an increased likelihood of an IUGR fetus. \\nPlacenta previa\\n is associated with an\\nincreased incidence of IUGR, probably because of the unfavorable site of placental implantation.\\nComplete placenta previa is associated with a higher incidence of IUGR than is partial placenta\\nprevia.

When not\\nassociated with fetal death or premature labor, premature placental separation may increase the risk of\\nIUGR. Malformations of the placenta or umbilical cord, such as \\nsingle umbilical artery (UA),\\nvelamentous umbilical cord insertion, circumvallate placenta, placental hemangioma, battledore\\nplacenta\\n, and \\ntwin-twin transfusion syndrome\\n, also are associated with an increased risk of IUGR.\\nChronic villitis\\n, chronic inflammation of placental villi, is seen with increased frequency when the\\nplacentas of IUGR pregnancies are examined histologically. Finally, \\nuterine anomalies\\n may be\\nassociated with impaired fetal growth, primarily because of suboptimal uterine blood flow.\\n4. Multiple gestation\\n—Multiple gestation has long been associated with premature delivery.\\nHowever, it also is associated with a 20–30% increased incidence of IUGR fetuses, most often as a\\nresult of placental insufficiency, twin-twin transfusion syndrome, preeclampsia, or anomalies. Fetal\\ngrowth has a direct relationship to the number of fetuses present and the type of placentation\\n(monochorionic vs. dichorionic). Serial ultrasound estimates of fetal weights should be considered in\\na multiple gestation pregnancy.\\nB. Maternal Factors\\nNumerous maternal diseases are associated with suboptimal fetal growth. Any woman who has borne\\n1 IUGR fetus is at increased risk for recurrence, with a 2-fold and 4-fold increased risk for IUGR birth\\nafter 1 or 2 IUGR births, respectively.\\n1. Hypertension\\n—Hypertension is the most common maternal complication causing IUGR. Systemic\\nhypertension results in decreased blood flow through the spiral arterioles and decreased delivery of\\noxygen and nutrients to the placenta and fetus. Hypertension may be associated with placental\\ninfarction.\\n2. Drugs\\n—Both social drugs and prescribed medications can affect fetal growth. \\nAlcohol\\n use has long\\nbeen known to be associated with impaired fetal growth. Virtually all infants with fetal alcohol\\nsyndrome exhibit signs of growth restriction.\\nCigarette smoking\\n is much more common among women of childbearing age in the United States\\nthan is alcoholism. Smoking causes one-third of IUGR cases and is the single most preventable cause\\nof IUGR pregnancy in the United States today. Women who smoke have a 3-fold to 4-fold increase in\\nIUGR infants. Birthweight is reduced by approximately 200 g, with the amount of growth restriction\\nproportional to the number of cigarettes smoked per day. Women who quit smoking at 7 months’\\ngestation have newborns with higher mean birthweights than do women who smoke throughout the\\nentire pregnancy. Women who stop smoking before 16 weeks’ gestation are not at increased risk for\\nhaving an IUGR fetus.\\nHeroin and cocaine are also associated with an increased risk of IUGR, but confounding variables\\nmake determination of a direct cause-and-effect relationship difficult. Methadone use has not been\\nshown to be associated with an increased incidence of IUGR.\\nPharmacologic agents have been associated with an increased incidence of IUGR, primarily as a\\nresult of teratogenic effects. Warfarin has been associated with an increased incidence of IUGR,\\nprimarily as a result of the sequelae of intrauterine hemorrhage. Folic acid antagonists are associated\\nwith an increased risk of spontaneous abortion stillbirth, severe malformations, and IUGR.\\nIUGR fetuses are more common with maternally administered immunosuppressive drugs (eg,\\ncyclosporine, azathioprine, corticosteroids), but when controlled for the underlying maternal disease,'),\n",

Furthermore, β-blockers are also\\nassociated with an increased risk of IUGR.\\n3. Malnutrition and malabsorption\\n—Maternal weight at birth, prepregnancy weight, and weight\\ngain during pregnancy account for 10% of the variance in fetal weight and increase the risk of\\ndelivering an infant <2500 g. Studies of infants borne by women who were pregnant during the Siege\\nof Leningrad during World War II showed that daily intake must be reduced to <1500 kcal/d before a\\nmeasurable effect on birthweight becomes evident. Maternal \\nmalabsorption\\n may predispose to IUGR\\npregnancy. The most common clinical situations are inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or\\nregional enteritis), pancreatitis, and intestinal parasites. \\nMaternal eating disorders\\n such as bulimia\\nand anorexia are also associated with IUGR.\\n4. Vascular disease and hypoxemia\\n—Diseases that affect maternal microvascular perfusion can be\\nassociated with IUGR. These include collagen vascular disease, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus\\nassociated with microvasculopathy, and preeclampsia. Also, chronic maternal hypoxemia due to\\npulmonary disease or cyanotic heart disease is associated with growth restriction.\\n5. Maternal features\\n—A small woman may have a smaller-than-normal infant because of reduced\\ngrowth potential. These mothers and infants are completely normal and healthy, but they are\\nconstitutionally small because of genetic variation. The ponderal index (PI) can be used to evaluate\\nwhether an infant is simply constitutionally small or is affected by IUGR. The PI is calculated using\\nthe following formula:\\nPI = [Weight (in g) × 100]/[length (in cm)]\\n3\\nInfants affected by asymmetric IUGR will have a low PI (ie, they will be long, lightweight infants\\nwith a PI below the 10th percentile), whereas small normal infants will have a normal PI.\\nWomen who were SGA at birth have a 2-fold increase in risk of IUGR in their offspring.\\nMaternal parity\\n exerts a modest effect on birthweight. First-born infants tend to be smaller and\\nmore often categorized as IUGR. This effect decreases with successive deliveries and is not seen\\nbeyond the third birth.\\n6. Sex of fetus\\n—At term, female fetuses are an average 5% (150 g) smaller and 2% (1 cm) shorter\\nthan male fetuses. Referring to separate norms for male and female fetuses may increase the power of\\nbiometry in assessing IUGR.\\nPrevention\\nBecause many causes of IUGR are not preventable, few interventions have proved effective for\\nprevention. Interventions that have shown benefit include smoking cessation, antimalarial\\nchemoprophylaxis, and balanced protein and energy supplementation. Smoking is the single most\\ncommon preventable cause of IUGR in infants born in the United States. As discussed in Maternal\\nFactors, women who quit smoking at 7 months’ gestation have newborns with higher mean\\nbirthweights than do women who smoke throughout the pregnancy. Women who quit smoking before\\n16 weeks’ gestation are not at any increased risk for an IUGR infant. Limited data suggest that\\nbalanced nutritional supplementation\\n improves mean birthweight.

Correction\\nof maternal anemia (of whatever cause) improves oxygen delivery to the fetus, thus improving fetal\\ngrowth. However, routine supplements, such as with iron, have not been shown to be associated with\\nany altered clinical outcomes.\\nTreatment of malabsorption syndrome (of whatever cause) can be expected to improve nutrient\\nabsorption and subsequent nutrient transfer to the fetus. Inflammatory bowel disease should be treated\\nif required, but if possible, pregnancy should be deferred until the disease has been quiescent for\\napproximately 6 months. Intestinal parasites should be appropriately treated and negative cultures\\nconfirmed prior to pregnancy.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Ultrasound Evaluation of Estimated Fetal Weight\\nThe diagnosis of IUGR is made when biometric parameters on ultrasound indicate that the EFW is\\nless than the 10th percentile for gestational age. In any pregnancy at risk for IUGR, baseline\\nultrasound studies should be obtained early in gestation. Careful attention should always be given to\\ngestational dating (menstrual history, serial examinations, biochemical pregnancy testing, quickening,\\nultrasound). An IUGR outcome, however, may develop in pregnancies without identified risk factors.\\nFor some pregnancies, the first sign of IUGR may be a lagging fundal height on clinical examination.\\nIf the fundal height varies from the assigned gestational age by more than 2 cm, ultrasound is\\nindicated to assess the EFW and amniotic fluid volume. Careful attention to fundal height\\nmeasurement is associated with 46–86% sensitivity for detecting IUGR.\\nUltrasound examination early in pregnancy is accurate in establishing the estimated date of\\nconfinement (EDC) and may sometimes identify genetic or congenital causes of IUGR pregnancy.\\nSerial ultrasound examinations are important in documenting growth and excluding anomalies.

The growth curves developed by\\nBattaglia and Lubchenco in the 1960s do not reflect the variation in birthweight for various ethnic\\npopulations.

Racial and ethnic anthropometric variations may suggest a need for specific charts\\nfor different communities.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nIf the fundal height on clinical examination is small, other diagnoses that should be entertained are\\noligohydramnios or a healthy pregnancy with the wrong due date (ie, the true gestational age is earlier\\nthan assigned). Ultrasound can help to differentiate among these diagnoses.\\nComplications\\nNumerous maternal and perinatal complications have been associated with IUGR pregnancies (\\nTable\\n16–1\\n). Underlying maternal disease is more likely to be present (\\nTable 16–3\\n), and these women\\nrequire more intensive prenatal care. Premature labor or preeclampsia is more common.

The past decade has witnessed increased attention to minimizing the perinatal\\ncomplications of surviving IUGR neonates.

During the\\ncompensated stage, diastolic flow in the UA is reduced or absent. Reversal of diastolic flow in the\\nUA is a sign of severe hypoxemia and acidemia. Although the use of UA Doppler studies for general\\npopulation screening remains unproven, it is recommended as the primary method of surveillance for\\nalready identified IUGR fetuses. Doppler flow studies, in particular the systolic-to-diastolic ratio\\n(S/D ratio), helps reduce unnecessary interventions and improve overall fetal outcome (including\\nreducing the risk of perinatal death) in IUGR pregnancies.

In those who are unable to mount this hyperinsulinemic response,\\nrelative hyperglycemia may develop (ie, gestational diabetes). Because glucose crosses the placenta\\nby facilitated diffusion, fetal hyperglycemia ensues. This in turn produces fetal hyperinsulinemia with\\nresultant intracellular transfer of glucose, leading to fetal macrosomia.'),\n",

Maternal Diabetes\\nMaternal diabetes, whether gestational, chemical, or insulin dependent, is the condition classically\\nassociated with fetal macrosomia. The “Pedersen hypothesis” was long assumed to account for fetal\\nmacrosomia, that is, the condition was the result of inadequate management of diabetes during\\npregnancy. Initial reports suggested that careful control of blood glucose level in insulin-dependent\\ndiabetic women would prevent fetal macrosomia, but recent studies have suggested that the problem is\\nnot so simple and that the incidence may correlate better with cord blood concentrations of maternally\\nacquired anti-insulin immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and/or increased serum levels of free fatty\\nacids, triglycerides, and the amino acids alanine, serine, and isoleucine.

Maternal Obesity\\nMaternal obesity is associated with a 3- to 4-fold increased likelihood of fetal macrosomia. The\\nincreased risk of macrosomia associated with maternal obesity appears to be independent of\\ncomorbidities such as gestational or pregestational diabetes.\\nC. Postdatism\\nProlonged pregnancy is more likely to result in a macro-somic fetus, presumably because of continued\\ndelivery of nutrients and oxygen to the fetus.\\nD. Genetic and Congenital Disorders\\nSeveral genetic and congenital syndromes are associated with an increased incidence of macrosomia.\\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome\\n is frequently associated with fetal macrosomia, usually because of\\npancreatic islet cell hyperplasia (nesidioblastosis).

Maternal Weight Gain\\nExcessive maternal weight gain in pregnancy is associated with macrosomia. A weight gain of more\\nthan 40 lb significantly increased the incidence of macrosomia by an odds ratio of 3.3.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of macrosomia and ensuing complications requires early detection of risk factors. Risk\\nfactors for \\nhaving a macrosomic infant include multiparity, advanced maternal age, and previous\\ndelivery of a macrosomic infant. When controlled for gestational age and fetal gender, the average\\nbirthweight with successive pregnancies increases by 80–120 g up to the fifth pregnancy.

The incidence of\\nshoulder dystocia correlates not only with increasing fetal weight but also with increasing chest\\ncircumference to HC. Shoulder dystocia of macrosomic infants also is related to maternal stature, but\\nthe association is not as clear. Approximately 10–15% of infants with shoulder dystocia experience\\nbrachial plexus injury; facial nerve injury and fractures of the humerus or clavicle also may be seen.\\nThe risk of fetal \\nbrachial plexus injury\\n in macrosomic infants delivered vaginally is 0.3–4%.\\nBrachial plexus injury with shoulder dystocia is approximately 7% in infants whose birthweights\\nexceed 4000 g but is 14% for mothers with gestational diabetes.

Multiple gestations now comprise 3% of all pregnancies, and\\ntwins comprise 25–30% of deliveries resulting from assisted reproductive technologies (ART).\\nSignificant maternal and neonatal effects are felt from this increase in multiple births. The financial\\ncosts are also staggering, with combined costs of ART plus pregnancy care, delivery, and neonatal\\ncare reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars in some cases. Maternal morbidity and mortality rates\\nare much higher in multiple pregnancy than in singleton pregnancy. Compared with singleton\\npregnancies, twin pregnancies are more likely to be complicated by hypertensive disorders,\\ngestational diabetes mellitus, anemia, preterm birth, ante- and postpartum hemorrhage, and maternal\\ndeath. Earlier and more precise sonography has revealed the incidence of multiple gestation to be\\n3.29–5.39% before 12 weeks.

In the second and third trimester, the demise\\nof 1 fetus in a multiple gestation may rarely trigger disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), just\\nas a singleton intrauterine demise might. This theoretical complication is so rare that DIC screening is\\nno longer performed.\\nB.

First-trimester ultrasonography is even more helpful\\nfor determining chorionicity and is becoming standard of care, especially since many patients undergo\\nfirst-trimester ultrasound for nuchal translucency (NT) screening. Interestingly, NT measurements are\\nsimilar for a given crown-rump length regardless if it is a singleton, twin, or higher order multiple\\ngestation.\\nThe maternal hematocrit and hemoglobin values and the red cell count usually are considerably\\nreduced, in direct relationship to the increased blood volume. Indeed, maternal hypochromic\\nnormocytic anemia is almost universal \\nbecause fetal demand for iron increases beyond the mother’s\\nability to assimilate iron in the second trimester.\\nC. Ultrasound Findings\\nUltrasonography is the preferred imaging modality for the diagnosis of multiple gestation and is\\npotentially able to differentiate multiple gestation as early as 4–5 weeks (by endovaginal probe).\\nDichorionicity is suggested by fetuses of different genders, separate placentas, a thick (>2 mm)\\ndividing membrane, or a “twin peak sign” in which the membrane inserts into 2 fused placentas. In the\\nabsence of these findings, monochorionicity is likely, particularly if the twins are spontaneously\\nconceived. A first-trimester scan is highly recommended since definitive diagnosis of chorionicity\\nmay not be possible with second- and third-trimester scans.

Ultrasonography can confirm the\\ndiagnosis.\\nComplications\\nA. Maternal\\nA gravida with a multiple pregnancy has about 5 times the likelihood of having a morbid (febrile,\\ncomplicated) course as an average patient of the same parity with a single fetus.\\nMultiple gestations are associated with an increased incidence of maternal anemia, urinary tract\\ninfection, preeclampsia-eclampsia, hemorrhage (before, during, and after delivery), and uterine atony.\\nAlthough blood volume is increased in multiple gestations, maternal anemia often develops because\\nof greater demand for iron by the fetuses. However, prior anemia, poor diet, and malabsorption may\\nprecede or compound iron deficiency during multiple gestation. Hypochromic normocytic anemia is\\n2–3 times more common in multiple pregnancy than in singleton pregnancy. Urinary tract infection is\\nat least twice as frequent in multiple pregnancy as in singleton pregnancy due to increased ureteral\\ndilatation secondary to higher serum progesterone and uterine pressure on the ureters. Preeclampsia–\\neclampsia occurs about 3 times more often in multiple pregnancy than in a singleton pregnancy.\\nAdditionally, respiratory tidal volume is increased, but the woman pregnant with twins often is\\n“breathless” (possibly due to increased levels of progesterone). Marked uterine distention and\\nincreased pressure on the adjacent viscera and pelvic vasculature are typical of multiple gestation.\\nTheca lutein cysts and even ascites may be seen as a result of abnormally high levels of chorionic\\ngonadotropin in occasional multiple pregnancies. The maternal cardiovascular, respiratory,\\ngastrointestinal, renal, and musculoskeletal systems are especially subject to stress in multiple\\npregnancy, combined with greater maternal–fetal nutritional requirements.\\nPlacenta previa develops more frequently because of the large size of the placenta or placentas.\\nPlacenta previa may be responsible for antepartum bleeding, malpresentation, or unengagement of the\\nfirst fetus. A large placenta (or placentas) and possibly fundal scarring or tumor may lead to low\\nimplantation of the placenta. Premature separation of the placenta may occur antepartum, perhaps in\\nassociation with preeclampsia–eclampsia or with rupture of membranes of twin A and the initiation of\\nstrong uterine contractions, or after the delivery of the first twin. Careless traction on the first cord\\nmay encourage early partial separation of the placenta.\\nA thinned uterine wall, secondary to unusually large uterine contents, is associated with hypotonic\\nuterine contractions and a longer latent stage of labor. However, prolonged labor is uncommon in\\nmultiple pregnancy because rupture of the membranes generally is followed by improvements in the\\nuterine contraction pattern. Hemorrhage is about 5 times as frequent in multiple as in single\\npregnancies. Uterine atony often is accompanied by excessive loss of blood postpartum due to\\ninability of the overdistended uterus to contract well and remain contracted after delivery.\\nOperative intervention is more likely in multiple pregnancy because of increased risk of obstetric\\nproblems such as malpresentation, prolapsed cord, and fetal distress.\\nGlucose tolerance tests demonstrate that rates of both gestational diabetes mellitus and gestational\\nhypoglycemia are much higher in multiple gestation compared with findings in singleton pregnancy.\\nThis is not surprising given the placental origin of human placental lactogen, which causes insulin\\nresistance.\\nB.

The incidence of spontaneous\\nabortion of at least 1 of several fetuses is increased in multiple pregnancy. Stillbirth occurs twice as\\noften among twins as among singleton pregnancies. Common causes of fetal death are developmental\\nanomalies, fetal growth restriction, cord compression, or placental disorders. In general, the higher the\\nnumber of fetuses, the greater is the risk of fetal growth restriction.\\nMonochorionic twin pregnancies have a substantially increased risk of death as compared with\\ntheir dichorionic counterparts because of the almost ever-present vascular anastomoses that may cause\\nthe twin–twin transfusion syndrome or acute feto-fetal hemorrhage after intrauterine demise of 1 twin.\\nThe greatest hazard from cord compression is cord entanglement of monozygotic twins with only 1\\namniotic sac. Almost twice as many monozygotic as dizygotic twins die in the perinatal period.\\nAttrition is even greater for triplets, quadruplets, and higher order pregnancies. Even so, preterm\\ndelivery and intrapartum complications are the most common causes of fetal loss and morbidity in\\nmultiple pregnancy.\\nPreterm premature rupture of the membranes and pre-term labor and delivery, often with a long\\nprodromal phase, are common occurrences in multiple pregnancy. The average gestational age at\\ndelivery is 36–37 weeks for twins, 33 weeks for triplets, and 31 weeks for quadruplets. Efforts to\\nreduce the incidence of prematurity have thus far been largely unsuccessful. All too frequently,\\npreterm delivery is occasioned by premature rupture of the membranes, which occurs in about 25% of\\ntwin, 50% of triplet, and 75% of quadruplet pregnancies. Delivery before the 36th week is twice as\\nfrequent in twin pregnancies as in singleton pregnancies. Intracranial injury is more common in\\npremature infants, even those delivered spontaneously. An increased risk of cerebral palsy is found in\\ntwins, especially very low-birthweight babies, and also in liveborn co-twins of fetuses who died in\\nutero.\\nProlapse of the cord occurs 5 times more often in multiple than in singleton pregnancy. Premature\\nseparation of the placenta before delivery of the second twin may cause death of the second twin by\\nhypoxia. When there are 2 separate placentas, 1 of them may deliver immediately after the first twin.\\nAlthough the second twin may not be compromised, it is best to proceed with its delivery, both for its\\nprotection and to conserve maternal blood.\\nMajor fetal structural malformations are present in approximately 2% of twin infants, compared\\nwith 1% of singletons, whereas minor malformations are found in 4% of twins compared with about\\n2.5% of singletons. Monozygotic twins are at higher risk than dizygotic twins.\\nFetal malpresentation is more common in multiple gestations. Both twins present in cephalic\\npresentation in almost 50% of cases.

Prenatal Diagnosis\\nThe usual indications for prenatal diagnosis and counseling in a singleton pregnancy also apply to\\ntwin and higher order gestations. Because the incidence of twin gestation increases with maternal age,\\nwomen with multiple gestations are often candidates for prenatal genetic diagnosis. Because the risk\\nof aneuploidy is increased, some centers offer invasive testing to all patients carrying multiple\\ngestations who will be over age 33 at delivery. Now that most patients have prenatal screening with\\nultrasound and/or maternal serum testing, the role of age is becoming less important for stratification\\nof risk for aneuploidy. Genetic counseling should make clear \\nto the patient the need to obtain a sample\\nfrom each fetus, the risk of a chromosomal abnormality, potential complications of the procedure, the\\npossibility of discordant results, and the ethical and technical concerns when 1 fetus is found to be\\nabnormal.\\nIn twin pregnancies not accompanied by neural tube defects, the median MSAFP level will be 2.5-\\nfold that of the median level for singleton pregnancies at 14–20 weeks’ gestation. The levels in triplets\\nand quadruplets are 3 and 4 times as high, respectively. A value greater than 4.5 times the median is\\nconsidered abnormal for twin gestations and requires a targeted ultrasound and possible amniocentesis\\nfor the determination of amniotic fluid α fetoprotein and acetylcholinesterase. Serum screening is less\\neffective in multiple gestations, with serum screening detecting only 47% of Down syndrome\\npregnancies. NT screening with first-trimester serum markers can detect about 70% of Down\\nsyndrome fetuses in twin pregnancies, with some added benefit to incorporating second-trimester\\nmarkers.\\nBoth amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling can safely be performed in multiple gestations in\\nexperienced centers. Careful documentation of the location of the fetuses and the membrane\\nseparating the sacs is important in case there is discordance for aneuploidy.

Antepartum Management\\nTo prevent the complications of multiple gestation, it is imperative to make the diagnosis as early in\\npregnancy as possible. Later in pregnancy, ultrasonography is useful to monitor the growth of the\\nfetuses and to detect structural anomalies. It is recommended to perform routine growth scans on\\ntwins every 4 weeks in the third trimester, or more frequently if growth restriction is detected.\\nAntepartum testing is routinely performed in twins with suspected intrauterine growth restriction or\\ngrowth discordance but is not universally performed in normally grown uncomplicated twins.\\nEnhanced antenatal care assists in improving outcome. The most commonly used techniques are\\niron and calcium supplementation, vitamin and folic acid administration (in an attempt to avoid\\nanemia), a high-protein diet, and more weight gain than usual (ideal weight for height plus 35–45 lb).\\nSupplementation with magnesium, zinc, and essential fatty acids has also been recommended.\\nThere is not enough evidence to suggest a policy of routine hospitalization for bed rest in multiple\\npregnancy because no reduction in the risk of preterm birth or perinatal death is evident. There is also\\nno evidence that prophylactic cerclage improves outcome. More frequent antenatal visits are\\nscheduled, and several authorities recommend closely following cervical length by ultrasound. Early\\nand prompt therapy for any complications (eg, vaginal infections, pre-eclampsia–eclampsia) should be\\ninstituted, bearing in mind that preeclampsia–eclampsia is a common complication of multiple\\npregnancy.\\nTocolytic drugs may be used to suppress premature labor and extend gestation 48 hours so that the\\neffects of steroids may be realized. There is no evidence that long-term oral or intravenous tocolysis\\nimproves outcome; however, this is still commonly practiced to a degree. Most authorities\\nrecommend starting with intravenous magnesium sulfate. If terbutaline is used, very close monitoring\\nfor pulmonary edema must be maintained, because this complication is much more likely with\\nadministration of β-mimetic agents in multiple gestation. Also, indomethacin is a very effective\\ntocolytic in the second and early third trimesters, but it may influence fetal ductal constriction and\\ndecreased amniotic fluid volume, complications that appear to be gestational age dependent, so it\\nshould not be used after 32 weeks’ gestation. Fetal fibronectin can be helpful, particularly when\\nnegative, to determine how aggressively to tocolyze.\\nNeonatal outcome is very much dependent on gestational age at delivery. In general, morbidity and\\nmortality rates are similar for twins and singletons of equivalent gestational ages. Advances in\\nneonatal intensive care have made survival possible even at 23 weeks’ gestation, although usually\\nwith considerable morbidity, including but not limited to intra-ventricular hemorrhage, chronic lung\\ndisease, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Because intact survival is much more likely after 32–34 weeks,\\nit is desirable to prolong gestation at least to this point when possible. The adage “1 day in utero saves\\n2 days in intensive care” applies to the economic as well as the emotional costs of caring for\\npremature infants. For the dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy that is otherwise uncomplicated,\\nrecent studies have found that neonatal morbidity is reduced when delivery is at about 38 weeks, so\\nroutine delivery at that time is recommended, by either induction of labor or caesarean if indicated.\\nOptimal treatment of twin–twin transfusion syndrome in utero remains controversial. Laser therapy\\nfor ablation of anastomotic placental vessels is available in several centers around the United States\\nand shows improved short-term survival as compared to expectant management and serial\\namnioreduction.

Labor & Delivery\\nAll patients carrying a multiple gestation should be delivered in a well-equipped hospital by an\\nexperienced physician who \\nhas adequate assistance. It is desirable to have a pediatrician (or\\nneonatologist) in attendance. Delivery must be done in the operating room in case an emergent\\ncaesarean section is needed for twin B. An early epidural is recommended; in case of emergent\\ncaesarean section, anesthesia is already established and general anesthesia can usually be avoided.\\nPrematurity, trauma of manipulative delivery, and associated asphyxia are the major preventable\\ncauses of morbidity and mortality in twins, especially the second twin.\\nAdmit the patient to the hospital at the first sign of suspected labor or preterm labor, if there is\\nleakage of amniotic fluid, or if significant bleeding occurs. We instruct patients to come in for >4\\ncontractions per hour at <34 weeks’ gestation. An ultrasound evaluation should be performed to\\nascertain the presentation of each fetus and its estimated fetal weight. Routine, continuous electronic\\nfetal heart rate monitoring is recommended. Labor should be conducted so that immediate caesarean\\nsection can be performed if required. A pediatric nurse team for each infant plus obstetric and\\nanesthesiologic attendants should be present. Insert an intravenous line and send a specimen of blood\\nfor typing, antibody screening, and complete blood count.\\nIf either twin shows signs of persistent compromise, proceed promptly to caesarean section\\ndelivery. Other indications for primary caesarean section include (but are not limited to)\\nmalpresentation, monoamniotic twins, gross disparity in fetal size, and placenta previa. In the United\\nStates, all higher order multiple gestations are delivered by caesarean delivery.\\nIn a woman with a previous lower segment caesarean scar, limited literature suggests that delivery\\nof twins does not mandate a repeat caesarean section in the absence of other complications.\\nConcomitant with increasing rates of elective and nonelective caesarean section, caesarean by patient\\nrequest is becoming more common. In addition, less resident training in vaginal breech delivery can\\ndecrease a clinician’s comfort with breech extraction of a second twin.\\nManagement of twins that are candidates for vaginal delivery may proceed as outlined below.\\nIntrapartum twin presentations may be classified as follows: (1) twin A and twin B cephalic (slightly\\n>40% of all twins); (2) twin A vertex and twin B noncephalic (almost 40%); and (3) twin A\\nnoncephalic and twin B cephalic, breech, or transverse (about 20%).\\nThe current intrapartum management of twins is as follows. For cephalic–cephalic presentations in\\nlabor (category 1 above), vaginal delivery of both twins may be chosen in the absence of standard\\nindications for caesarean section delivery. Of course, if either twin develops fetal distress, caesarean\\nsection delivery should be performed. Category 2 twins, each >32 weeks and weighing more than\\n1500–2000 g, can usually be managed successfully by vaginal delivery of both. This is generally\\naccomplished by total breech extraction of twin B immediately after the delivery of twin A if the\\npatient has been consented for this procedure. External cephalic version of twin B has also been\\ndescribed. While external version was previously recommended for conversion of twin B from breech\\nto cephalic, now most operators deliver vaginal second twins by complete breech extraction. When\\neither twin A or both twins are noncephalic (category 3), primary caesarean section should be\\nperformed. This is also sometimes recommended in cases of noncephalic twin B where the estimated\\nfetal weight is much greater than that of twin A.

Common causes of third-trimester bleeding.\\n• Grade 1: A small amount of vaginal bleeding and abnormal uterine activity or irritability are usually\\nnoted. The fetal heart rate tracing is within normal limits. Maternal hemodynamic status is normal,\\nand all coagulation studies and laboratory values are within normal limits.\\n• Grade 2: A mild to moderate amount of vaginal bleeding is noted.

Maternal hemodynamic status shows signs of compensation,\\nincluding orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia, while maintaining overall blood pressure.\\nMaternal fibrinogen may be decreased.\\n• Grade 3: External uterine bleeding may range from mild (likely concealed) to severe. The uterus is\\ntypically painful and tetanic. Fetal death has occurred. Maternal hemodynamic status is unstable,\\nshowing signs of severe volume depletion with hypotension and tachycardia. Thrombocytopenia and\\ncoagulation panel value abnormalities are present. Fibrinogen concentration level is typically <150\\nmg/dL.\\nThe primary cause of placental abruption is unknown in most cases; however, it has been linked to\\nseveral risk factors. \\nMechanical force or trauma is sometimes implicated, usually as a result of\\ndomestic violence or a motor vehicle accident. The clinical picture following a traumatic event can be\\nsevere in nature, and symptoms typically present within 24 hours. Blunt abdominal trauma can\\ncompress the placental interface, allowing for a shearing effect when decompression occurs. Rapid\\ndeceleration is the typical inciting event during a motor vehicle accident. Prolonged continuous fetal\\nmonitoring is critical in assuring the safety of the pregnancy. The mechanical force of rapid\\ndecompression of the uterus is an uncommon etiology. This can occur after the delivery of the first\\ninfant during the vaginal delivery of a twin gestation or after rupture of membranes in a patient with\\npolyhydramnios.\\nSeveral factors can put a patient at risk for this disease.

Hypertension with concomitant cigarette\\nsmoking during pregnancy further increases the risk of abruption.\\nThe relationship between age and the risk of placental abruption is not clear when other\\nconfounding factors, such as hypertension and multiparity, are corrected. Most authors feel that there\\nis no direct correlation; however, a Norwegian study done over 15 years showed a strong relationship\\nbetween placental abruption and maternal age among all levels of parity.\\nIncreasing parity is a risk factor for placental abruption. The incidence in primigravidas is 1%, and\\nthis incidence increases to 2.5% in grand multiparas, correcting for confounding factors.

A nonreassuring fetal heart rate tracing or poor\\nbiophysical profile score may indicate fetal compromise from a decrease in the placental exchange\\nsurface area or from severe maternal hypotension due to a large blood loss.\\n• Tetanic uterine activity (ie, contractions).\\n• Uterine bleeding, external or concealed.\\nPrompt evaluation is critical in caring for the patient with third-trimester uterine bleeding and\\npossible placental abruption.

More\\nthan 50% of patients with confirmed abruption will have evidence of hemorrhage on ultrasound.\\nEchogenicity, size, and location of the hemorrhage can be described, allowing the clinician to better\\nunderstand the timing and severity of the abruption. If the ultrasound is performed during the early\\nphases of the abruption, the area of hemorrhage will appear isoechoic or hyperechoic compared with\\nthe echogenicity of the placenta. The hematoma becomes hypoechoic within 1 week and sonolucent\\nwithin 2 weeks of the initial hemorrhage.\\nThe size and location of the hematoma are important in evaluating the severity of the abruption. A\\nlarger hematoma is associated with a worse prognosis than a smaller hematoma. A retroplacental\\nhemorrhage has a worse prognosis than a subchorionic hemorrhage, which is defined as a collection of\\nblood between the chorion and the decidua. A retroplacental hemorrhage that is >60 mL in volume has\\nat least a 50% morality rate associated with it.\\nPrevention\\nAlthough no intervention has been shown to prevent placental abruption, known risk factors for\\nplacental abruption include poorly controlled maternal hypertension, smoking, and cocaine use.\\nCounseling patients against smoking and cocaine use and helping them find appropriate cessation\\nprograms may reduce the risk of abruption, as may anti-hypertensive medication for women with\\npoorly controlled hypertension.\\nTreatment\\nThe hemodynamic status of the mother should be immediately evaluated and stabilization performed\\nif necessary. Two large-bore intravenous lines should be placed, and the fetal heart rate should be\\nmonitored continuously. Crystalloid infusion should be started to rapidly correct the volume deficit,\\nand packed red blood cells should be given if severe anemia is evident or if there is continued uterine\\nbleeding. Urine output should be maintained above 30 mL/h. If no transfusion is required\\nimmediately, 4 units of packed red blood cells should be crossed and held nearby. Fresh frozen plasma\\nshould be administered for a fibrinogen level <100 mg/dL, and platelets should be given if the platelet\\ncount is <20,000 or <50,000 for a patient with severe continued hemorrhage or a requirement for\\nemergent caesarean delivery. The clinician should not be falsely reassured by normal blood pressure\\nand pulse, as the patient may have had hypertension previously and has had too rapid a volume loss to\\nproduce tachycardia.\\nMode and timing of delivery depend greatly on the severity of the placental abruption and the\\ngestational age of the pregnancy. If a grade 1 abruption has occurred and the gestational age is >37\\nweeks, the most appropriate course of action is induction or augmentation of labor with very close\\nmonitoring of the maternal and fetal status at all times.

This is mostly seen with increasing numbers of caesarean sections. The risk of placenta\\nprevia in second pregnancies after a first pregnancy delivered by caesarean section is 1–4%. The risk\\nincreases to nearly 10% in patients with 4 or more previous caesarean deliveries. Furthermore, it has\\nbeen suggested that previas identified in the second trimester in patients with a previous caesarean\\ndelivery have a lower likelihood of resolving as the pregnancy progresses. Risk increases with\\nprevious curettage for spontaneous or induced abortion, thought to be due to a scarred active segment\\nof the uterus.\\nOther risk factors for placenta previa include multiple gestation and smoking. This is due to the\\ngreater surface area of the placenta in these situations.\\nPlacenta previa can be associated with several other conditions, including malpresentation, preterm\\npremature rupture of membranes, and intrauterine growth restriction. There may also be an increased\\nrisk of congenital anomalies; however, there is no association with any specific anomaly.\\nPatients with placenta previa are at higher risk for developing placenta accreta, increta, or percreta.\\n• Placenta accreta: There is no decidua basalis, and the fibrinoid layer is incompletely developed.\\n• Placenta increta: The placenta invades the myometrium.\\n• Placenta percreta: The placenta penetrates the myometrium and may invade nearby viscera.\\nPrevious uterine surgery is the risk factor most associated with placenta accreta. Patients with no\\nprior uterine surgery and placenta previa will have accreta 4% of the time. Patients with 1 prior\\nuterine surgery and placenta previa will have accreta 10–35% of the time.

Symptoms & Signs\\nPlacenta previa typically presents with painless vaginal bleeding, usually in the third trimester. Lack\\nof pain with the presence of bleeding is what distinguishes placenta previa from placental abruption.\\nThe bleeding occurs in conjunction with the development of the lower uterine segment. As the\\nmyometrium becomes thinner, the placenta–decidua interface is disrupted, causing bleeding. The\\nthinness of the lower uterine segment prevents it from contracting to minimize the bleeding from the\\nuterine surface of the implantation site; however, sometimes the bleeding itself can irritate the\\nmyometrium and precipitate contractions.\\nThe clinician should have a high index of suspicion for placenta previa in all patients who present\\nwith bleeding after 24 weeks. One-third of patients with placenta previa will present with bleeding\\nbefore 30 weeks, one-third will present between 30 and 36 weeks, and one-third will present after 36\\nweeks.

Risk of\\nperinatal mortality and morbidity decreases linearly as gestational age increases.\\nB. Laboratory Findings\\nBaseline admission labs including blood type and Rh status, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet\\ncount should be sent.

Currently, most cases are diagnosed by ultrasound in the second\\ntrimester, although most of these will resolve. Five to fifteen percent of all patients will have placenta\\nprevia at 17 weeks. Ninety percent of these will resolve by 37 weeks. This occurs because as the lower\\nuterine segment develops, more distance is created between the placenta and the cervix. Complete\\nprevia and marginal or partial previa diagnosed in the second trimester will persist in 26% and 2.5%\\nof patients, respectively. All patients who have placenta previa diagnosed before 24 weeks should\\nhave a sonogram between 28 and 32 weeks to reassess the position of the placenta.\\nTreatment\\nThe initial management of a patient with a bleeding placenta previa is very similar to the initial\\nmanagement of a patient with placental abruption. Hemodynamic status of the mother should be\\nimmediately evaluated and stabilization performed if necessary. Large-bore intravenous lines should\\nbe placed, and the fetal heart rate should be monitored continuously.\\nHemodynamic stabilization should be performed immediately. Crystalloid infusion should be\\nstarted in order to rapidly correct a volume deficit, and packed red blood cells should be given if\\nsevere anemia is evident or if there is continued uterine bleeding. The goal hematocrit is at least 30%\\nif the patient is bleeding. If no transfusion is required immediately, 4 units of packed red blood cells\\nshould be crossed and held nearby. The urine output should be maintained above 30 mL/h.\\nSubsequent management depends on gestational age, stability of the mother and fetus, the amount\\nof bleeding, and presentation of the fetus. Delivery is always indicated if there is a nonreassuring fetal\\nheart rate pattern despite resuscitation efforts, including maternal supplemental oxygen, left-side\\npositioning, or intravascular volume replacement; if there is life-threatening maternal hemorrhage; or\\nif the gestational age is >34 weeks and there is known fetal lung maturity. If the fetus is ≥37 weeks of\\ngestational age and there is persistent bleeding or persistent uterine activity, delivery is also indicated.\\nDigital cervical exams should be avoided.\\nBetween 24 and 36 weeks, if maternal and fetal stability and well-being are assured, conservative\\nexpectant management may be indicated.

Thirty percent of patients treated this way will progress to term without bleeding again.\\nSeventy percent will have at least 1 more episode of bleeding, and 10% of these patients will have a\\nthird episode.\\nConservative management, after stabilization has occurred and little or no uterine bleeding is\\nnoted, consists of several steps.

Abdominal delivery is indicated in most\\ncases of placenta previa and in all cases of complete previa. If a caesarean section is performed, care\\nshould be taken not to disrupt the placenta upon fetal delivery. If possible, a uterine incision away\\nfrom the placental bed should be used. For example, if there is an anterolateral placenta, a vertical\\nincision in the lower uterine segment opposite the site of placental implantation should be used. A\\nhigh transverse incision may be necessary for a low anterior placenta. In all cases, the operating room\\nshould be prepared for the possibility of the necessity to perform a hysterectomy.\\nAs noted earlier, 66% of patients with placenta accreta will require a caesarean-hysterectomy.\\nThere are several surgical options if uterine preservation is important. The placenta can be removed\\nand the uterine defect can be oversewn to abate the active focus of bleeding. The area of accreta can be\\nresected and the uterus repaired. The last option includes leaving the placenta in situ. This is only\\nacceptable in patients who are not actively bleeding. The cord should be ligated and cut close to its\\nbase. The patient should be treated with antibiotics and possibly methotrexate postpartum. In the rare\\ncase where bladder invasion is evident, the placenta should not be removed.

This can occur with a velamentous\\ninsertion of the umbilical cord, where Wharton’s jelly is not present to protect the fetal vessels, or in\\nthe case where a succenturiate lobe of the placenta has a vascular communication traversing the os.\\nRupture of these vessels can occur with or without rupturing membranes, and the result is fetal\\nexsanguination.

Symptoms & Signs\\nThe typical presentation of vasa previa is vaginal bleeding that occurs upon rupture of membranes\\nwith concomitant specific changes in the fetal heart rate tracing. With the onset of bleeding, the fetal\\nheart responds to loss of intravascular \\nvolume with reflex tachycardia. Reflex tachycardia is usually\\nfollowed by bradycardia accompanied by occasional accelerations. With severe fetal anemia, a\\nsinusoidal fetal heart rate pattern may be seen. The clinician must have a high index of suspicion in\\norder to make the correct diagnosis in enough time to prevent fetal death.\\nB. Laboratory Findings\\nVery rarely, the fetal heart rate does not show signs of acute volume loss, and the blood can be\\nanalyzed to determine its origin. The Apt, Ogita, and Loendersloot tests take between 5 and 10\\nminutes to perform and are available to identify fetal hemoglobin. They have varying sensitivities\\ndepending on the amount of dilution of the blood with amniotic fluid. However, these tests are\\nprimarily of historical interest. If a patient is bleeding from a diagnosed or strongly suspected vasa\\nprevia, caesarean delivery should be expedited.\\nC. Imaging Studies\\nWith improvement in ultrasound technology and an increased awareness among providers about this\\ndisorder, many cases are now being diagnosed in the antepartum period via ultrasound. The ultrasound\\nfinding of either velamentous cord insertion or succenturiate lobe of the placenta should prompt\\nproviders to evaluate for vasa previa. The use of color Doppler during transvaginal ultrasound can\\nclearly identify fetal vessels coursing through the fetal membranes and can establish the diagnosis. If'),\n",

Vasa previa can be distinguished from funic presentation (free loops of\\numbilical cord resting adjacent to the cervix) by mapping the fetal vessels from the placenta or cord\\ninsertion. Additionally, changes in maternal position may allow for free cord as in funic presentation\\nto move, whereas vessels in a vasa previa will remain in place.\\nTreatment\\nIf a patient presents with the previously mentioned classic findings, the appropriate course of action is\\nto deliver immediately via caesarean section to prevent impending fetal demise. If the patient has\\nbeen identified antenatally, it is recommended that the patient be monitored very closely for any\\nevidence of vaginal bleeding and to administer corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturity. Several\\nexperts recommend inpatient observation starting at 32 weeks.

Eight possible\\npositions are recognized: sacrum anterior (SA), sacrum posterior (SP), left sacrum transverse (LST),\\nright sacrum transverse (RST), left sacrum anterior (LSA), left sacrum posterior (LSP), right sacrum\\nanterior (RSA), and right sacrum posterior (RSP). The \\nstation\\n of the breech presenting part is the\\nlocation of the fetal sacrum with regard to the maternal ischial spines.\\nPathogenesis\\nBefore 28 weeks, the fetus is small enough in relation to intrauterine volume to rotate from cephalic to\\nbreech presentation and back again with relative ease. As gestational age and fetal weight increase, the\\nrelative decrease in intrauterine volume makes such changes more difficult. In most cases, the fetus\\nspontaneously assumes the cephalic presentation to better accommodate the bulkier breech pole in the\\nroomier fundal portion of the uterus.\\nBreech presentation occurs when spontaneous version to cephalic presentation is prevented as term\\napproaches or if labor and delivery occur prematurely before cephalic version has taken place. Some\\ncauses include oligohydramnios, polyhydramnios, uterine anomalies such as bicornuate or septate\\nuterus, pelvic tumors obstructing the birth canal, abnormal placentation, advanced multiparity, and a\\ncontracted maternal pelvis.\\nIn multiple gestations, each fetus may prevent the other from turning, with a 25% incidence of\\nbreech in the first twin, nearly 50% for the second twin, and higher percentages with additional\\nfetuses. Additionally, 6% of breech presentations are found to have congenital malformations, which\\ninclude congenital hip dislocation, hydrocephalus, anencephalus, familial dysautonomia, spina bifida,\\nmeningomyelocele, and chromosomal trisomies 13, 18, and 21. Thus, those conditions that alter fetal\\nmuscular tone and mobility increase the likelihood of breech presentation.'),\n",

Palpation & Ballottement\\nPerformance of Leopold’s maneuvers and manual ballottement of the uterus through the maternal\\nabdominal wall may confirm breech presentation. The softer, more ill-defined breech may be felt in\\nthe lower uterine segment above the pelvic inlet. Diagnostic error is common, however, if these\\nmaneuvers alone are used to determine presentation.\\nB. Pelvic Examination\\nDuring vaginal examination, the round, firm, smooth head in cephalic presentation can easily be\\ndistinguished from the soft, irregular breech presentation if the presenting part is palpable. However,\\nif no presenting part is discernible, further studies are necessary (ie, ultrasound).\\nC. Radiographic Studies\\nX-ray studies will differentiate breech from cephalic presentations and help determine the type of\\nbreech by locating the position of the lower extremities. X-ray studies can reveal multiple gestation\\nand skeletal defects. Fetal attitude may be seen, but fetal size cannot readily be determined by x-ray\\nfilm. Because of the risks of radiation exposure to the fetus with this technique, ultrasonography is\\nnow used instead of radiography to determine fetal presentation or malformations.\\nD. Ultrasound\\nUltrasonographic scanning by an experienced examiner will document fetal presentation, attitude, and\\nsize; multiple gestation; location of the placenta; and amniotic fluid volume. Ultrasound also will\\nreveal skeletal and soft tissue malformations of the fetus.\\nComplications\\nA. Birth Anoxia\\nUmbilical cord compression and prolapse may be associated with breech delivery, particularly in\\ncomplete (5%) and footling (15%) presentations. This is due to the inability of the presenting part to\\nfill the maternal pelvis, either because of prematurity or poor application of the presenting part to the\\ncervix so that the umbilical cord is allowed to prolapse below the level of the breech (see below).\\nFrank breech presentation offers a contoured presenting part, which is better accommodated to the\\nmaternal pelvis and is usually well applied to the cervix. The incidence of cord prolapse in frank\\nbreech is only 0.5% (the same as for cephalic presentations). Compression of the prolapsed cord may\\noccur during uterine contractions, causing moderate to severe variable decelerations in the fetal heart\\nrate and leading to fetal anoxia or death. If breech vaginal delivery is attempted, continuous electronic\\nmonitoring is mandatory during labor \\nin these cases to detect ominous decelerations. If they occur,\\nimmediate caesarean delivery must be performed.\\nB. Birth Injury\\nThe incidence of birth trauma during vaginal breech delivery is 6.7%, 13 times that of cephalic\\npresentations (0.51%). Only high forceps and internal version and extraction procedures have higher\\nrates of birth injury than do vaginal breech deliveries. The types of perinatal injuries reported in\\nbreech delivery include tears in the tentorium cerebellum, cephalohematomas, disruption of the spinal\\ncord, brachial palsy, fracture of long bones, and rupture of the sternocleidomastoid muscles.

The type of procedure used may affect the\\nneonatal outcome.\\n1. Partially dilated cervix\\n—Delivery of a breech fetus may progress even though the cervix is only\\npartially dilated because the bitrochanteric and bisacromial diameters are smaller than the biparietal\\ndiameter. This is true especially in prematurity. The hips and shoulders may negotiate the cervix, but\\nthe aftercoming head becomes entrapped, resulting in difficult delivery and birth injury.\\n2. Nuchal arms\\n—During partial breech extraction and more often in total breech extraction, excessive\\ndownward traction on the body results in a single or double nuchal arm. This occurs because of the\\nrapid descent of the body, leading to extension of 1 or both arms, which become lodged behind the\\nneck. When delivery of the shoulder is difficult to accomplish, a nuchal arm should be suspected. To\\ndislodge the arm, the operator rotates the body 180 degrees to bring the elbow toward the face. The\\nhumerus can then be identified and delivered by gentle downward traction. In cases of double nuchal\\narm, the fetus is rotated counterclockwise to dislodge and deliver the right arm and rotated clockwise\\nto deliver the left arm. If this action is unsuccessful, the operator must insert a finger into the pelvis,\\nidentify the humerus, and possibly extract the arm, resulting in fracture of the humerus or clavicle.\\nNuchal arms cause a delay in delivery and increase the incidence of birth asphyxia.\\n3. Deflexion of the head\\n—\\nHyperextension of the head\\n is defined as deflexion or extension of the head\\nposteriorly beyond the longitudinal axis of the fetus (5% of all breech deliveries). Causes of\\nhyperextension include neck cysts, spasm of the neck musculature, and uterine anomalies, but over\\n75% have no known cause. Although deflexion may be documented by ultrasonographic or x-ray\\nstudies weeks before delivery, there is little apparent risk to the fetus until vaginal delivery is\\nattempted. At that time, deflexion causes impaction of the occipital portion of the head behind the\\npubic symphysis, which may lead to fractures of the cervical vertebrae, lacerations of the spinal cord,\\nepidural and medullary hemorrhages, and perinatal death. If head deflexion is diagnosed prior to\\ndelivery, caesarean section should be performed to avert injury. Caesarean section cannot prevent\\ninjuries such as minor meningeal hemorrhage or dislocation of the cervical vertebrae, which may\\ndevelop in utero secondary to longstanding head deflexion.\\n4. Type of delivery\\n—More complex delivery procedures have a higher rate of birth trauma. Whereas\\nfew infants are injured during spontaneous breech births, as many as 6% are injured during partial\\nbreech extraction and 20% during total breech extraction of singleton infants. Injuries associated with\\ntotal breech extraction of singleton infants usually are extensive and severe, and this procedure should\\nnever be attempted unless fetal survival is in jeopardy and caesarean section cannot be immediately\\nperformed.\\nAn additional important factor in breech injury and perinatal outcome is the experience of the\\noperator. Inexperience may lead to hasty performance of obstetric maneuvers. Delay in delivery may\\nresult in birth asphyxia due to umbilical cord compression, but haste in the management of breech\\ndelivery results in application of excessive pressure on the fetal body, causing soft tissue damage and\\nfracture of long bones. Too-rapid extraction of the body from the birth canal causes the arms to extend\\nabove the head, resulting in unilateral or bilateral nuchal arms and difficult delivery of the\\naftercoming head.

Antepartum Management\\nFollowing confirmation of breech presentation, the mother must be closely followed to evaluate for\\nspontaneous version to cephalic presentation. If breech presentation persists beyond 36 weeks,\\nexternal cephalic version should be considered (see below). Version is a procedure used to turn the\\nfetal presenting part from breech to cephalic presentation (cephalic version) or from cephalic to\\nbreech presentation (podalic version). Because cephalic version is performed by manipulating the\\nfetus through the abdominal wall, the maneuver is known as \\nexternal cephalic version\\n. Podalic\\nversion is performed by means of internal maneuvers and is known as \\ninternal podalic version\\n (see\\nbelow). External cephalic version is regaining popularity, whereas internal podalic version is rarely\\nused.\\nIn women considering a vaginal breech delivery of a singleton infant, radiographic pelvimetry\\nusing x-ray, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed to rule out\\nwomen with a borderline or contracted pelvis. Attempts at vaginal delivery with an inadequate pelvis\\nare associated with a high rate of difficulty \\nand significant trauma to mother and fetus. Difficult\\nvaginal delivery may still occur in women with adequate pelvic measurements.\\nExternal cephalic version\\n is used in the management of singleton breech presentations or in a\\nnonvertex second twin. In carefully selected patients, it is safe for both mother and fetus. The goal is\\nto increase the proportion of vertex presentations near term, thus increasing the chance for a vaginal\\ndelivery. In the past, external cephalic version was performed earlier in gestation but was\\naccompanied by high reversion rates, making additional procedures necessary. Now it is performed in\\npatients who have completed 36 weeks of gestation so that the risk of spontaneous reversion is\\ndecreased, and, if complications arise, delivery of a term infant can be accomplished. Current success\\nrates for external cephalic version range from 35 to 85% (mean 60%).\\nPatients with unengaged singleton breech presentations of at least 36 weeks’ gestation are\\ncandidates for external cephalic version. The procedure is more successful in multigravidas, those\\nwith a transverse or oblique lie, and those with a posterior placenta. Use of fetal heart rate monitoring\\nand real-time ultrasonography is essential to document fetal well-being during the procedure. The use\\nof tocolytics in external cephalic version is controversial. Recent evidence indicates that tocolytics\\noffer an advantage in nulliparous women, but reports on which type of tocolytic confers the highest\\nsuccess rate are conflicting. Thus, these agents should be used at the discretion of the physician.\\nAdditionally, evidence regarding the use of regional anesthesia is inconsistent. Recent randomized\\ncontrolled trials have shown an increased success rate in those with epidural anesthesia. However, the\\nultimate decision should be based on physician experience.\\nContraindications to external cephalic version include engagement of the presenting part in the\\npelvis, marked oligohydramnios, placenta previa, uterine anomalies, presence of nuchal cord, multiple\\ngestation, premature rupture of membranes, previous uterine surgery (including myomectomy or\\nmetroplasty), and suspected or documented congenital malformations or abnormalities (including\\nintrauterine growth retardation).\\nComplications are rare, occurring in only 1–2% of all external cephalic versions.

Technique\\n—External cephalic version is performed by first obtaining informed consent from the\\npatient. An ultrasound examination is performed to verify presentation and to rule out fetal or uterine\\nabnormalities. A nonstress test is done, and results must be reactive.

Nevertheless, broader familiarity with the technique is needed because\\nunanticipated vaginal breech delivery is still encountered.\\n1. Caesarean delivery\\n—The type of incision chosen is extremely important. If the lower uterine\\nsegment is well developed, as is usually the case in women at term in labor, a transverse “lower\\nsegment” incision is adequate for easy delivery. In premature gestations, in an unlabored uterus, or in\\nmany cases of malpresentation, the lower uterine segment may be quite narrow, and a low vertical\\nincision is almost always required for atraumatic delivery.\\n2. Vaginal delivery\\n—Obstetricians who contemplate performing a vaginal breech delivery should be\\nexperienced in the maneuver and should be assisted by 3 physicians: (1) an experienced obstetrician\\nwho will assist with delivery; (2) a pediatrician capable of providing total resuscitation of the\\nnewborn; and (3) an anesthesiologist, to ensure that the \\nmother is comfortable and cooperative during\\nlabor and delivery. The type of anesthesia required depends on the type of breech delivery.\\nMultiparous women undergoing spontaneous breech delivery may require no anesthesia or only\\nintravenous analgesia for pain relief during labor and a pudendal anesthetic during delivery. Epidural\\nanesthesia may also be administered during labor or in anticipation of partial breech extraction,\\nincluding application of Piper forceps to the aftercoming head. In emergency circumstances, complete\\nrelaxation of the perineum and uterus is essential for a successful outcome.

S\\nPONTANEOUS VAGINAL DELIVERY\\n—During spontaneous delivery of an infant in the frank breech\\nposition, delivery occurs without assistance, and no obstetric maneuvers are applied to the body. The\\nfetus negotiates the maternal pelvis as outlined below, while the operator simply supports the body as\\nit delivers.\\nEngagement occurs when the bitrochanteric diameter of the fetus has passed the plane of the pelvic\\ninlet. As the fetus descends into the pelvis (\\nFig. 19–2\\n), the buttocks reach the levator ani muscles of\\nthe maternal pelvis. At this point, internal rotation occurs, whereby the anterior hip rotates beneath the\\npubic symphysis, resulting in a sacrum transverse position. The bitrochanteric diameter of the fetal\\npelvis is now in an anteroposterior position within the maternal pelvis. The breech then presents at the\\npelvic outlet and, upon emerging, rotates from sacrum transverse to sacrum anterior. Crowning occurs\\nwhen the bitrochanteric diameter passes under the pubic symphysis. As this occurs, the shoulders\\nenter the pelvic inlet with the bisacromial diameter in the transverse position. As descent occurs, the\\nbisacromial diameter rotates to an oblique or anteroposterior diameter, until the anterior shoulder\\nrests beneath the pubic symphysis. Delivery of the anterior shoulder occurs as it slips beneath the\\npubic symphysis. Upward flexion of the body allows for easy delivery of the posterior shoulder over\\nthe perineum.'),\n",

As the\\nknee flexes, the foot is often seen or easily palpated. The lower leg is grasped firmly and gently\\ndelivered, and the opposite leg is then delivered. The rest of the body is extracted as previously\\ndescribed for footling presentation.\\nFigure 19–9\\n. Delivery of breech with 1 finger in the groin.

I\\nNTERNAL PODALIC VERSION\\n—Internal podalic version is now rarely used because of the high fetal\\nand maternal morbidity and mortality associated with the procedure. It is occasionally performed as a\\nlife-saving procedure or in cases of a noncephalic second twin (see \\nChapter 17\\n for delivery of a second\\ntwin). Internal podalic version is the only alternative to caesarean section for rapid delivery of the\\nsecond twin in a noncephalic presentation if external cephalic version fails.

The cervix must be\\ncompletely dilated, and the membranes must be intact. A skilled operator is crucial for safe\\nperformance of this procedure. In several French studies, internal podalic version was found to be a\\nreliable and effective technique with excellent long-term maternal and fetal prognoses.\\nInternal podalic version is contraindicated in cases in which the membranes are ruptured or\\noligohydramnios is present, precluding easy version. This procedure should not be performed through\\na partially dilated cervix or if the uterus is firmly contracted down on the fetal body. However, recent\\nstudies have indicated that intravenous nitroglycerin can be used to provide transient uterine\\nrelaxation without affecting maternal or fetal outcome.\\nInternal podalic version is associated with considerable risk of traumatic injury to both fetus and\\nmother. Prior to 1950, when this procedure was performed much more frequently than it is today,\\nassociated uterine rupture and hemorrhage caused 5% of all maternal deaths. Perinatal mortality rates\\nwere 5–25% (primarily due to traumatic intracerebral hemorrhage and birth asphyxia). Considerable\\nbirth trauma, including long bone fractures, dislocations, epiphyseal separations, and central nervous\\nsystem deficits, was also linked to this procedure. For these reasons, internal podalic version has been\\nabandoned with rare exceptions in favor of caesarean section.\\nInternal podalic version is performed by first establishing an intravenous line for administration of\\nparenteral fluids, including blood. Cross-matched blood should be available in the hospital blood\\nbank. Anesthesia is then administered to relax the uterus. The patient is then placed in the\\ndorsolithotomy position. The operator’s hand is inserted through the fully dilated cervix along the\\nfetal body until both feet are identified, and traction is applied to bring the feet into the pelvis and out\\nthe introitus. Then, both feet are firmly grasped. An amniotomy is then performed, and dorsal traction\\nis applied on both lower extremities until both feet are delivered through the vagina. A total breech\\nextraction for delivery of the body is then performed (\\nFig. 19–11\\n).'),\n",

Prolapse of a lower extremity in cephalic presentation is relatively\\nrare.\\n Compound presentations are uncommon, occurring in only 1 in 1000 pregnancies.\\nPathogenesis\\nObstetric factors that prevent descent of the presenting part into the pelvic inlet predispose to prolapse\\nof an extremity alongside the presenting part (ie, prematurity, cephalopelvic disproportion, multiple\\ngestation, grand multiparity, and hydramnios). Prematurity occurs in over 50% of compound\\npresentations. In twin gestations, over 90% of compound presentations are associated with the second\\ntwin.\\nBecause of poor application of the presenting part to the cervix found in compound presentations,\\numbilical cord prolapse is common (occurring in 11–20% of cases) and is a major contributor to fetal\\nloss during labor.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe diagnosis of compound presentation is made by palpation of a fetal extremity adjacent to the\\npresenting part on vaginal examination. The diagnosis is usually made during labor; as the cervix\\ndilates, the prolapsed extremity is more easily palpated alongside the vertex or breech. Compound\\npresentation may be suspected if poor progress in labor is noted, particularly when the presenting part\\nfails to engage during the active phase. If the diagnosis of compound presentation is suspected but\\nuncertain, ultrasound can be used to locate the position of the extremities and search for\\nmalformations.\\nComplications\\nUmbilical cord prolapse is a risk in all cases of compound presentation, and continuous fetal heart rate\\nmonitoring should be performed to detect fetal distress or changes in the fetal heart rate. Umbilical\\ncord complications should be managed by immediate caesarean delivery (see below).\\nTreatment\\nManagement of compound presentation depends on gestational age and type of presentation. Given\\nthat 50% of compound presentations are associated with prematurity, viability of the fetus should be\\ndocumented prior to delivery. If the fetus is considered nonviable, labor should be permitted and'),\n",

The small size of the fetus makes dystocia or difficult vaginal delivery\\nuncommon.\\nLabor can be allowed and vaginal delivery anticipated in viable cephalic presentations with a\\nprolapsed hand. These cases generally pose no difficulty in labor or delivery because the hand moves\\nupward into the lower uterine segment as the vertex descends into the birth canal. Therefore, expectant\\nmanagement (as opposed to manual reduction of the fetal hand into the uterus) is generally advised.\\nPrognosis\\nCompound presentations have been associated historically with perinatal mortality rates ranging from\\n9 to 19%. Contributing factors are prematurity, prolapsed umbilical cord, and traumatic vaginal\\ndelivery.\\nSHOULDER DYSTOCIA\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n \\nShoulder dystocia\\n is defined as an inability to deliver the shoulders after the head has delivered.\\n Characteristically, after the head is delivered, the chin presses tightly against the perineum as the\\nanterior shoulder becomes impacted behind the pubic symphysis.\\n This condition is an acute obstetric emergency requiring prompt, skillful management in order to\\nprevent significant fetal damage or death.\\n The incidence of shoulder dystocia ranges from 0.15 to 1.7% of all vaginal deliveries.\\nPathogenesis\\nPrimary risk factors that can influence clinical management are fetal macrosomia, gestational or overt\\ndiabetes mellitus, a history of shoulder dystocia in a prior birth, a prolonged second stage of labor, and\\ninstrumental delivery, particularly a midpelvic delivery. Other risk factors, such as a history of a\\nmacrosomic infant, maternal obesity, multiparity, and postterm pregnancy, are mediated through the\\nprimary risk factors. However, most women who experience shoulder dystocia have no combination of\\nrisk factors that allows clinically useful identification.\\nPrevention\\nEfforts at prevention focus on patients with the clinically important risk factors: history of shoulder\\ndystocia, macrosomia by estimated fetal weight (EFW), diabetes, prolonged second stage of labor, and\\ninstrumental delivery. Although no study has shown conclusively that offering caesarean delivery in\\nthe presence of various combinations of these risk factors is advisable from a risk–benefit analysis,\\nmost practitioners apply some or all of these in an attempt to reduce the risk of shoulder dystocia. An\\nexample of one approach follows.\\n1. Prior shoulder dystocia: Offer caesarean.\\n2. Prior brachial plexus injury: Strongly suggest caesarean.\\n3.

Macrosomia by EFW: Avoid instrumental delivery.\\nIt should be noted that labor induction in a nondiabetic woman due to suspected fetal macrosomia\\ndoes not decrease the occurrence of shoulder dystocia nor does it decrease the rate of caesarean\\nsection.\\nClinical Findings\\nShoulder dystocia should be anticipated given any indications of macrosomia. The diagnosis is\\nconfirmed when gentle downward pressure on the head fails to deliver the anterior shoulder from\\nbehind the pubic symphysis. At this point, the fetus is at risk for asphyxiation as the fetus cannot\\nexpand its chest to breathe, and umbilical cord circulation is compressed within the birth canal.\\nConfronted with this terrifying dilemma, the inexperienced operator often continues to apply\\ndownward pressure on the head in a vain attempt to deliver the anterior shoulder. Such action should\\nbe avoided, not only because it is ineffective but also because it can potentially damage the brachial\\nplexus and result in permanent Erb’s palsy. A number of maneuvers designed to alleviate shoulder\\ndystocia without increasing traction have been described. No specific sequence of these maneuvers\\nhas be shown to be superior to any other, but a commonsense approach based on ease of performance\\nand limitations of risk can be described. Initially, the operator places a hand in the birth canal to\\nassess the posterior outlet. If inadequate, an episiotomy or a proctoepisiotomy is performed. At the\\nsame time, assistants including a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist are summoned to aid in the\\ndelivery.\\nComplications\\nBirth injuries related to shoulder dystocia include fracture of the humerus or clavicle and injury to the\\nbrachial plexus (\\nErb’s palsy\\n). Fractures of the humerus and clavicle generally heal without incident,\\nand most injuries to the brachial plexus resolve with minimal or no neurologic deficit detectable\\nduring the neonatal period. However, approximately 10% of cases of Erb’s palsies do not resolve.\\nStudies attempting to distinguish the clinical course of patients with permanent injuries from those\\nwith transient injuries have found no clinically distinct characteristics. Some severe cases of shoulder\\ndystocia may lead to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and possible death. Maternal complications of\\nshoulder dystocia include postpartum hemorrhage and lacerations involving the cervix, vagina, and\\nperineum\\nTreatment\\nThe \\nMcRoberts’ maneuver\\n should be used initially because it is simple and resolves shoulder\\ndystocia in 42% of cases. The maternal legs are hyperflexed onto the maternal abdomen, resulting in\\nflattening of the sacrum and cephalad rotation of the symphysis pubis. If the shoulders remain\\nundelivered, suprapubic pressure is applied by an assistant to dislodge the anterior shoulder while\\ngentle downward pressure on the head is applied. Suprapubic pressure and/or proctoepisiotomy\\nincreases success rates to between 54% and 58%. If these attempts are unsuccessful, the examiner can\\nattempt to rotate the fetal shoulders into the oblique position by placing 2 fingers against the posterior\\nshoulder and pushing it around toward the fetal chest (\\nRubin maneuver\\n) or pushing the posterior\\nshoulder around toward the fetal back (\\nWood’s maneuver\\n) in a corkscrew fashion.\\nIf the maneuvers to this point fail, delivery of the posterior arm (Barnum maneuver) is indicated.'),\n",

If not, the trunk\\ncan be rotated to bring the free arm anteriorly, resulting in delivery. Deliberate fracture of the clavicle\\nalso can be performed, preferably in a direction away from the fetal lungs. This action diminishes the\\nsize of the shoulder girdle and should facilitate delivery.\\nFinally, if all previous techniques fail, a \\nZavanelli maneuver\\n can be performed in which the fetal\\nhead is replaced in anticipation of a caesarean delivery.

The incidence of occult\\nprolapse is unknown because it can be detected only by fetal heart rate changes characteristic of\\numbilical cord compression. However, some degree of occult prolapse appears to be common, given\\nthat as many as 50% of monitored labors demonstrate fetal heart rate changes compatible with\\numbilical cord compression. In most cases, the compression is transient and can be rectified simply by\\nchanging the patient’s position.\\nWhether occult or overt, umbilical cord prolapse is associated with significant rates of perinatal\\nmorbidity and mortality because of intermittent compression of blood flow and resultant fetal\\nhypoxia. The perinatal mortality rate associated with all cases of overt umbilical cord prolapse\\napproaches 20%. Prematurity, itself a contributor to the incidence of umbilical cord prolapse,\\naccounts for a considerable portion of this perinatal loss.\\nPathogenesis\\nAny obstetric condition that predisposes to poor application of the fetal presenting part to the cervix\\ncan result in prolapse of the umbilical cord. Cord prolapse is associated with prematurity (<34 weeks’\\ngestation), abnormal presentations (breech, brow, compound, face, transverse), occiput \\nposterior\\npositions of the head, pelvic tumors, multiparity, placenta previa, low-lying placenta, and\\ncephalopelvic disproportion. In addition, cord prolapse is possible with polyhydramnios, multiple\\ngestation, or premature rupture of the membranes occurring before engagement of the presenting part.\\nA recent study revealed that obstetric intervention contributes to nearly half of cases of umbilical cord\\nprolapse. Examples cited include amniotomy, scalp electrode application, intrauterine pressure\\ncatheter insertion, attempted external cephalic version, and expectant management of preterm\\npremature rupture of membranes.\\nPrevention\\nPatients at risk for umbilical cord prolapse should be treated as high-risk patients. Patients with fetal\\nmalpresentation or poorly applied cephalic presentations should be considered for ultrasonographic\\nexamination at the onset of labor to determine fetal lie and cord position within the uterine cavity.\\nBecause most prolapses occur during labor as the cervix dilates, patients at risk for cord prolapse\\nshould be continuously monitored to detect abnormalities of the fetal heart rate. Artificial rupture of\\nmembranes should be avoided until the presenting part is well applied to the cervix. At the time of\\nspontaneous membrane rupture, a prompt, careful pelvic examination should be performed to rule out\\ncord prolapse. Should amniotomy be required and the presenting part remains unengaged, careful\\nneedling of the membranes and slow release of the amniotic fluid can be performed until the\\npresenting part settles against the cervix.\\nClinical Findings\\nA.

Incerpi, MD\\nAn operative delivery refers to an obstetric procedure in which active measures are taken to\\naccomplish delivery. Operative delivery can be divided into operative vaginal delivery and caesarean\\ndelivery. The last several years have seen a steady decline in the operative delivery with an increase in\\nthe caesarean section rate. In addition, vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery has become more common\\nthan forceps. Most recent data from births in the United States during 2005 indicate that the vacuum-\\nto-forceps ratio is approximately 4:1. The success and safety of these procedures are based on operator\\nskill, proper timing, and ensuring that proper indications are met while contraindications are avoided.\\nThis chapter explains how each procedure is performed, the indications and contraindications to the\\nprocedure, the potential complications, and how to minimize complications.\\nFORCEPS OPERATIONS\\nThe obstetric forceps is an instrument designed to assist with delivery of the baby’s head. The\\ninvention of the precursor to modern forceps is credited to Peter Chamberlin in the 1600s. It is used\\neither to expedite delivery or to assist with certain abnormalities in the cephalopelvic relationship that\\ninterfere with advancement of the head during labor. The primary functions of the forceps are to assist\\nwith traction of the fetal head and/or to assist with rotation of the fetal head to a more desirable\\nposition.\\nAlthough forceps-assisted vaginal deliveries were once extremely popular, the most recent data\\ndemonstrate that only one-quarter of all operative vaginal deliveries are performed using forceps. The\\nreverse was true approximately 10 years ago. In fact, many investigators are concerned that the use of\\nforceps is becoming a lost art. The reasons often cited in contributing to the decline in the use of\\nforceps are (1) medicolegal implications and fear of litigation, (2) reliance on caesarean section as a\\nremedy for abnormal labor and suspected fetal jeopardy, (3) perception that the vacuum is easier to\\nuse and less risky to fetus and mother, and (4) decreased number of residency programs that actively\\ntrain residents in the use of forceps. These factors have led to a cycle in which less teaching has led to\\na decrement in technical skills, an increased fear of litigation, and a resultant further decrease in the\\nuse of forceps.\\nTHE OBSTETRIC FORCEPS\\nThe obstetric forceps (\\nFig. 20–1\\n) consists of 2 matched parts that articulate or “lock.” Each part is\\ncomposed of a blade, shank, lock, and handle. Each blade is designed so that it possesses 2 curves: the\\ncephalic curve, which permits the instrument to be applied accurately to the sides of the baby’s head,\\nand the pelvic curve, which conforms to the curved axis of the maternal pelvis. The tip of each blade\\nis called the toe. The front of the forceps is the concave side of the pelvic curve. The blades are\\nreferred to the left and right according to the side of the mother’s pelvis on which they lie after\\napplication. During application, the handle of the left blade is held in the left hand, and the blade is\\napplied to the left side of the mother’s pelvis. Conversely, the handle of the right blade is held in the'),\n",

When the blades are\\ninserted in this order, the right shank comes to lie atop the left so that the forceps articulate, or lock,\\nas the handles are closed.\\nFigure 20–1\\n. DeLee modification of Simpson forceps. (Reproduced, with permission, from Benson\\nRC. \\nHandbook of Obstetrics & Gynecology\\n. 8th ed. Los Altos, CA: Lange; 1983.)\\nPhysicians have been modifying 1 or more of the 4 basic parts since forceps were first invented.\\nAlthough more than 600 kinds of forceps have been described, only a few are currently in use (\\nFig.\\n20–2\\n). Although it is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss all the different varieties of forceps\\nand their indications, a brief comment on the more common types of forceps is appropriate. Simpson\\nor Elliot forceps are most often used for outlet vaginal deliveries, whereas Kielland or Tucker-\\nMcLane forceps are used for rotational deliveries. Piper forceps are used in the United States for\\ndelivery of the aftercoming head in vaginal breech deliveries. The pelvic and cephalic curve, shank,\\nblade, lock, and handle are different \\nfor each type of forceps. These features determine the type of\\nforceps that is best suited for the appropriate indication. For example, Piper forceps, which are\\nspecifically designed for breech deliveries, have a reverse pelvic curve compared to other forceps.\\nSimpson forceps are suited for application to the molded fetal head, whereas Tucker-McLane forceps\\nor Kielland forceps are more appropriate to the fetal head with little or no molding.'),\n",

Los Altos, CA: Lange; 1983.)\\nINDICATIONS & CONDITIONS FOR FORCEPS DELIVERY\\nIn each of the following indications for forceps delivery, it must be emphasized that caesarean section\\nis an alternative procedure that should be considered depending on the prevailing circumstances.\\nRecognizing the inherent risks of both procedures, the obstetrician must decide which operation\\n(vaginal delivery or caesarean section) will be safer for the mother and baby.\\nThe indications for forceps delivery are as follows: (1) nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern, (2)\\nshortening of the second stage of labor for maternal reasons, (3) prolonged second stage of labor not\\ndue to dystocia, and (4) delivery of the aftercoming head in a breech presentation. A prolonged second\\nstage of labor has been defined according to parity. In a nulliparous patient, a prolonged second stage\\nis defined as more than 3 hours with a regional anesthetic or more than 2 hours without a regional\\nanesthetic. In a multiparous patient, more than 2 hours with a regional anesthetic or more than 1 hour\\nwithout a regional anesthetic constitutes a prolonged second stage of labor.\\nIn order for the patient to be considered a candidate for forceps-assisted vaginal delivery with a\\ncephalic presentation, \\nall\\n of the following prerequisites must be met: (1) complete cervical dilatation,\\n(2) ruptured membranes, (3) fetal head engaged with the fetal head position known, (4) empty bladder,\\n(5) no evidence of cephalopelvic disproportion, (6) adequate analgesia, (7) caesarean section\\ncapability, and (8) an experienced operator.\\nCLASSIFICATION OF FORCEPS DELIVERIES\\nIn 1988 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists redefined the classification of\\nforceps. As discussed later, the same classification should be applied to vacuum delivery. This\\nclassification uses the leading bony point of the fetal skull and its relationship to the maternal ischial\\nspines in centimeters as the point of reference. Each station of the fetal head refers to the relationship\\nof the leading bony part of the fetal skull with respect to the ischial spines. The fetal head is said to be\\nat 0 station when the head is at the level of the spines. When the head is above this level, the station is\\ndescribed as –1 through –5, corresponding to the number of centimeters above the level of the ischial\\nspines. When the head is below this level, the station is described as +1 through +5, corresponding to\\nthe number of centimeters below the level of the ischial spines.\\nThe classification of forceps is defined as follows:\\n1. \\nOutlet forceps\\n is the application of forceps when (a) the fetal scalp is visible at the introitus\\nwithout separating the labia, (b) the fetal skull has reached the pelvic floor, (c) the sagittal suture\\nis in the anteroposterior diameter or in the right or left occiput anterior or posterior position, and\\n(d) the fetal head is at or on the perineum. According to this definition, rotation of the fetal head\\nmust be ≤45 degrees.\\n2. \\nLow forceps\\n is the application of forceps when the leading point of the fetal skull is at station +2\\nor greater and not on the pelvic floor. Low forceps have 2 subdivisions: (a) rotation ≤45 degrees\\nand (b) rotation >45 degrees.\\n3. \\nMidforceps\\n is the application of forceps when the head is engaged but the leading point of the\\nfetal skull is above station +2.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Only rarely should an attempt be made at forceps delivery above station +2. Under unusual\\ncircumstances, such as sudden onset of severe fetal or maternal compromise or transverse arrest,\\napplication of forceps above station +2 can be attempted while simultaneously initiating preparation\\nfor a caesarean delivery in case the forceps maneuver is unsuccessful. \\nUnder no circumstances should\\nforceps be applied to an unengaged head\\n.\\nPREPARATION OF THE PATIENT FOR FORCEPS DELIVERY\\nThe patient must be placed in the dorsal lithotomy position and the bladder should be emptied. The\\nlegs should be comfortably placed in stirrups with the hips flexed and abducted. The abdomen and\\nlegs should be adequately draped, and the vagina and the perineum should be prepped in usual fashion.\\nIf conduction (spinal/epidural) anesthesia is to be used, it must be administered prior to the foregoing\\nsteps in delivery. If pudendal block or local infiltration is to be used, it should be administered after\\nthe preliminary examination has been performed and all is in readiness for delivery. An appropriate\\nand effective anesthetic is essential to the performance of a forceps delivery.\\nThe Preliminary Examination\\nBefore the application of forceps, a careful examination if necessary to determine the following:\\n1. \\nThe position of the fetal head\\n, which usually is easily determined by first locating the lambdoid\\nsutures and then determining the direction of the sagittal suture. The posterior fontanelle is readily\\nevident after the 3 sutures running into it are identified. If the most accessible fontanelle is found\\nto have 4 sutures running into it, it is the anterior fontanelle and the position usually is occiput\\nposterior. In the presence of marked edema of the scalp or caput succedaneum, both sutures and\\nfontanelles may be masked, and the position can only be determined by feeling an ear and noting\\nthe direction of the pinna. It must be emphasized that if the position of the fetal head cannot be\\nadequately determined, then forceps should not be applied.\\n2. \\nThe station of the fetal head\\n, which is the relationship of the presenting part to the ischial spines,\\nmust be determined. In labor that proceeds swiftly without complications, such a determination\\nusually is simple and accurate. However, when the first or especially the second stage of labor is\\nprolonged and is further complicated by marked molding and a heavy caput, this relationship may\\nsuggest a false level of the head in the pelvis. If the head can be felt above the symphysis pubis,\\nforceps should not be used.\\n3. \\nThe adequacy of the pelvic diameters\\n of the midpelvis and outlet is determined by noting the\\nfollowing: (a) the prominence of the ischial spines, the degree to which \\nthey shorten the transverse\\ndiameter of the midpelvis, and the amount of space between the spine and the side of the fetal\\nhead; (b) the contour of the accessible portion of the sacrum and the amount of space posterior to\\nthe head usually based on the length of the sacrospinous ligament; and (c) the width of the\\nsubpubic arch. This kind of appraisal is neither needed nor feasible for outlet forceps, but is\\nessential for indicated low forceps or midforceps.\\nAPPLICATION OF FORCEPS\\nA major concept to bear in mind is that the application of forceps should use finesse rather than force.\\nBefore the forceps are applied to the fetal head, a “phantom application” should be performed first. It\\nis vital to inspect the forceps to ensure that they consist of a complete and matched set and that they\\narticulate (lock) easily. Forceps should be applied in a delicate fashion in order to avoid potential'),\n",

The goal is for the blades to fit the fetal head as evenly and\\nsymmetrically as possible. The blades should lie evenly against the side of the head, covering the\\nspace between the orbits and ears (\\nFig. 20–3\\n). It is important to emphasize that correct application\\nprevents soft tissue and nerve injury, as well as bony injuries to the fetal head. After the forceps have\\nbeen applied, they should articulate easily. If the forceps cannot be easily articulated, the forceps\\nshould be removed and a second attempt made. Once the forceps articulate, the following checks\\nshould be performed for delivery of an occiput anterior position before any traction is placed on the\\nfetal head. (1) The sagittal suture should be perpendicular to the plane of the shanks. (2) The posterior\\nfontanelle should be 1 finger-breadth away from the shanks equidistant from the sides of the blades,\\nand directly in front of the articulated forceps. (3) If fenestrated (open) blades are used, the amount of\\nfenestration in front of the fetal head should admit no more than the tip of 1 finger. After these checks\\nhave been performed, then traction can safely be applied to the fetal head. Traction forces should be\\napplied in the plane of least resistance and should follow the pelvic curve. This can best be\\naccomplished by applying downward pressure on the shanks with outward pressure exerted upon the\\nhandle of the forceps. Once the fetal head begins to emerge out of the vagina, the forceps are\\ndisarticulated, and the head is delivered via a modified Ritgen maneuver. After delivery, it is\\nimportant to ensure that no vaginal or perineal lacerations go unrecognized, paying particular\\nattention to deep lateral vaginal sidewall (sulcal) lacerations. Lacerations, if present, should be\\nrepaired in customary fashion.\\nFigure 20–3\\n.

After the 3 checks have been adequately performed,\\ntraction can be applied.\\nObstetricians hold forceps for traction in different ways. One method is to grab the crossbar of the\\nhandle between the index and middle fingers of the left hand from underneath and to insert the middle\\nand index fingers of the right hand in the crotch of the instrument from above. Another method is to\\ngrasp the handles with the fingers on the top of the handles or shanks and the thumbs on the bottom.\\nTraction is made only in the axis of the pelvis along the curve of the birth canal. No more force is\\napplied than can be exerted by the flexed forearms; the muscles of the back must be used, and the feet\\nmust not be braced.

The head\\nnegotiates the final position of the pelvic curve by extension, and the physician should simulate this\\nmovement by elevating the handles of the forceps more and more as the head crowns (\\nFig. 20–7\\n).

Maternal complications include lacerations of\\nthe vagina and cervix, episiotomy extensions involving third- and fourth-degree lacerations, pelvic\\nhematomas, urethral and bladder injuries, and uterine rupture.

Such errors include failure to recognize the\\nessential conditions for forceps delivery and lack of an appropriate indication for the operation as\\noutlined earlier. The potential for injury increases in the following settings: (1) intervention occurs\\ntoo early, before maximal molding and descent have been achieved by the patient’s voluntary efforts,\\n(2) continued traction is used in the presence of unrecognized cephalopelvic disproportion, (3) errors\\nin diagnosis of the position of the fetal head, and (4) unwillingness to abandon the procedure and'),\n",

The perception of increased fetal\\nand maternal risk has served as one of the major driving forces contributing to the widespread decline\\nin the use of forceps.\\nTHE VACUUM EXTRACTOR\\nThe idea of using a suction device applied to the fetal scalp to help facilitate deliver of the fetal head\\noriginated in the 1700s. The first vacuum cup was not designed until 1890. As one could well imagine,\\nthe first types of vacuum devices were crude, resembling a toilet plunger. In fact, the vacuum device\\ndid not gain much popularity until Malmström introduced a metal vacuum cup in 1954. The most\\ncommon type of vacuum in use today is a pliable, Silastic cup with a handheld pump and gauge that\\nallow delivery of the proper amount of suction pressure to the fetal head to effect delivery. Two\\nmodels are shown in \\nFigures 20–8\\n and \\n20–9\\n. The vacuum extractor works by allowing the external\\ntraction forces applied to the fetal scalp to be transmitted to the fetal head. The traction on the vacuum\\napparatus increases the forces of delivery and facilitates passage of the fetus through the pelvis. In\\norder for delivery to be accomplished, both traction on the fetal scalp and compression of the fetal\\nhead occur.\\nFigure 20–8\\n. Mityvac obstetrical vacuum delivery system includes extractor cup and pump.\\n(Photograph reproduced with permission of CooperSurgical, Inc., Trumball, CT)\\nFigure 20–9\\n.

In addition, as\\nmentioned earlier, the classification of forceps deliveries is the same classification used for vacuum\\ndeliveries, \\nand the prerequisites are similar. Contraindications for vacuum delivery include the\\nfollowing: face presentation, breech presentation, true cephalopelvic disproportion, congenital\\nanomalies of the fetal head (eg, hydrocephalus), gestational age <34 weeks, an unengaged fetal head,\\nfetal demineralization disorder (eg, osteogenesis imperfecta), and known or suspected fetal bleeding\\ndiatheses (eg, hemophilia). In addition, caution must be exercised when the estimated fetal weight is\\n>4000 g.\\nVACUUM APPLICATION\\nBefore the vacuum is applied to the fetal head, the patient is prepared and the initial patient\\nexamination is performed as discussed earlier with regard to forceps deliveries. Application of the\\nvacuum is perceived by many to be simpler than the use of the forceps. Before application occurs, the\\nvacuum system should be assembled to ensure that no leaks are present. The cup should then be\\ninserted into the vagina by directing pressure toward the posterior aspect of the vagina. The objective\\nis to place the center of the cup directly over the sagittal suture at the \\nmedian flexion point\\n located\\napproximately 3 cm anterior to the posterior fontanelle. This cup placement should allow for adequate\\nmaintenance of flexion of the fetal head during the entire procedure. The following checks should be\\nperformed prior to application of traction to the fetal head. (1) No maternal tissue should be included\\nunder the cup margin. (2) The cup should be placed in the midline over the sagittal suture and not off\\nto the side of the head.\\nAfter the cup has been appropriately placed on the fetal scalp, an initial suction is applied, and the\\ncup edges are reexamined to ensure that no maternal tissue is trapped underneath the vacuum cup.\\nWhile the cup is held firmly against the fetal head, the pressure is increased to approximately 100–150\\nmm Hg to maintain the cup’s position. The cup edges should be reexamined. If no maternal tissue is\\nfound under the cup edges, the pressure is increased to 500–600 mm Hg at the beginning of the uterine\\ncontraction. As the mother pushes, traction is applied downward along the pelvic axis. If more than 1\\ncontraction is necessary, the vacuum pressure can be decreased to low levels between contractions.\\nThe axis of traction is then extended upward to a 45-degree angle to the floor as the head emerges.\\nOnce the head has completely delivered through the vagina, the suction is withdrawn and the cup\\nremoved.\\nEFFECTIVENESS & SAFETY OF VACUUM\\nMost reports demonstrate that the vacuum is effective, with a failure rate of approximately 10%. The\\nfollowing factors have been implicated in determining the effectiveness of vacuum delivery: cup\\ndesign, shape, size, and traction site attachment, consistency and strength of vacuum, strength of\\nmaternal expulsive efforts and coordination with traction, fetal size and extent of cephalopelvic\\ndisproportion, station and deflection of the fetal head, and angle and technique of traction.\\nThe safety of the vacuum has been called into question. In May 1998, the US Food and Drug\\nAdministration issued a Public Advisory Statement regarding fetal complications associated with\\nvacuum delivery. The purpose of this statement was to advise practitioners that vacuum devices might\\ncause serious or fetal complications when improperly used. As a result, the following\\nrecommendations were made. (1) The vacuum should be used only when a specific obstetric'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='indication is present. (2) Persons using the vacuum should be experienced and aware of the\\nindications, contraindications, and precautions. (3) Those who use the vacuum should read and\\nunderstand the instructions for the particular instrument being used. (4) The neonatal care staff should\\nbe educated about the potential complications of vacuum. (5) Individuals responsible for the care of\\nthe neonate should be alerted that vacuum has been used. (6) All adverse reactions should be reported\\nto the Food and Drug Administration.\\nUse of the vacuum has been associated with a variety of neonatal injuries ranging from benign\\nsuperficial scalp markings to serious and potentially life-threatening intracranial hemorrhages. The\\nmost common neonatal complication is retinal hemorrhage, which may occur in as many as 50% of\\ndeliveries. Fortunately, the complication rarely has any clinical significance. Cephalohematoma\\ninvolves bleeding beneath the periosteum and complicates approximately 6% of all vacuum\\ndeliveries. Because the bleeding is located under the periosteum, significant bleeding rarely results\\nbecause of the inability of the blood to cross the sutures. Subgaleal hematoma, a more serious\\ncomplication, occurs in 50 per 10,000 vacuum deliveries. The condition arises when bleeding occurs\\nin the loose subaponeurotic tissues of the scalp. Because bleeding occurs above the periosteum, \\nit is\\nnot contained by the sutures. Consequently, there is the potential for life-threatening hemorrhage. The\\nsubgaleal space actually extends from the orbits of the eyes to the nape of the neck. This potential\\nspace can accommodate over half of a newborn’s blood volume. Intracranial hemorrhage occurs in\\napproximately 0.35% of vacuum deliveries. It can be a catastrophic complication that includes\\nsubdural, subarachnoid, intraventricular, and/or intraparenchymal hemorrhage. These complications\\ncan be quite severe but fortunately are rare.\\nMost authorities agree that injury can be significantly decreased or eliminated if the following\\nprotocol is used. (1) Traction is applied only when the patient is actively pushing. (2) Applying torsion\\nor twisting the cup in an attempt to rotate the head is prohibited. (3) The duration of time during\\nwhich the cup is applied to the fetal head should not exceed 20 minutes. (4) The procedure should be\\nabandoned after the cup has dislodged or “popped off” from the fetal head twice. It should not be\\napplied a third time. (5) The procedure should be abandoned if there is no fetal descent after a single\\npull. (6) Neonatal staff should be present at the time of the vacuum delivery. (Note: This also applies\\nto forceps deliveries.) (7) Under no circumstances should the operator switch from vacuum to forceps\\nor vice versa. An excellent study examining neonatal injury associated with operative vaginal delivery\\nclearly demonstrated that the greatest incidence of neonatal injury occurred in babies in whom both\\nvacuum and forceps were used. The practitioner must be cognizant of the risk of shoulder dystocia,\\nwhich is increased with instrumental delivery.

It would also be prudent to include a comment in the medical record that the patient was\\ninformed of the potential complications of operative vaginal delivery.\\nSomewhat surprisingly, relatively few randomized, prospective studies have compared vacuum\\nwith forceps. In surveying the medical literature, the following conclusions can be drawn. On the\\nwhole, the vacuum extractor is less likely to achieve a successful vaginal delivery than is the forceps.\\nThe vacuum is significantly less likely to cause serious maternal injury than is the forceps. Although\\nthe vacuum is associated with a greater incidence of cephalohematoma, other facial/cranial injuries\\nare more common with forceps. In comparing Apgar scores, the trend is toward more low 5-minute\\nApgar scores in the vacuum group than in the forceps group. Thus, an overall reduction in severe\\nmaternal injuries appears to be the most immediate benefit associated with the use of the vacuum.\\nHowever, at this time, which instrument results in fewer major adverse neonatal effects remains to be\\ndetermined.\\nAlthough both forceps and vacuum have proved to be useful in assisting with vaginal delivery, the\\nvacuum is quickly becoming the preferred instrument of choice. Both forceps and vacuum extractors\\nare acceptable and safe instruments for operative vaginal delivery. While candidates should be\\nselected on an individualized basis and counseled accordingly, the skill of the operator should also\\ninfluence the decision to attempt an operative delivery as well as the choice of instrument. Each\\ninstrument, however, has inherent risks. While the vacuum has been primarily associated with\\nimmediate neonatal morbidity, long-term data do not suggest any increased risk of\\nneurodevelopmental delay in children delivered by either vacuum or forceps. In order to minimize\\nboth maternal and fetal risks, the operator must be familiar with the indications, contraindications,\\napplication, and use of the particular instrument. Guidelines similar to those discussed in this chapter\\nshould exist in order to facilitate a safe and effective delivery. While maternal morbidity may be\\nslightly higher with forceps delivery, it is overall low in comparison with the morbidity that may be\\nassociated with delivery by caesarean section.

The first documented caesarean section \\non a living person\\nwas performed in 1610. The patient died 25 days later. Since that time, numerous advances have made\\ncaesarean section a safe procedure. In the past 35 years, the rate of caesarean section has steadily'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='increased from 5% to approximately 30%. Over this time, the maternal mortality ratio (maternal\\ndeaths per 100,000 births) has decreased from almost 300 to <10. The following factors are often cited\\nas contributing to the increasing caesarean section rate: (1) lower operative vaginal delivery rates, (2)\\nlower rates of vaginal births after caesarean section (VBAC), and (3) fewer vaginal breech deliveries.\\nIn order for the practitioner to perform this common operation safely, he or she must be aware of the\\nindications, risks, operative technique, and potential complications of this procedure.\\nINDICATIONS\\nCaesarean section is used in cases where vaginal delivery either is not feasible or would impose undue\\nrisks to the mother or baby. Some of the indications for caesarean section are clear and\\nstraightforward, whereas others are relative. In some cases, fine judgment is necessary to determine\\nwhether caesarean section or vaginal delivery would be better. It is not practical to list all possible\\nindications; however, hardly any obstetric complication has not been dealt with by caesarean section.\\nThe following indications are currently the most common.\\nRepeat Caesarean Section\\nA prior uterine incision from a myomectomy or previous caesarean section may weaken the uterine\\nwall or predispose to rupture if labor is permitted. The initial dictum of “once a caesarean, always a\\ncaesarean” was held for many years. However, as multiple publications documenting the safety of\\nVBAC began appearing in the literature, many physicians moved away from this long-held belief. In\\n2000, a national goal was set to lower the rate of repeat caesarean sections to 3% while increasing the\\nVBAC rate to 35%. The major incentives that led to this change in philosophy were fewer delivery\\nrisks with vaginal delivery, less need for anesthesia, less postpartum morbidity, shorter hospital stay,\\nlower costs, and the encouragement of earlier and often smoother interaction and bonding between\\nmother and infant. As more and more VBACs were performed in less than ideal settings, more\\ncomplications arose. There may be no greater obstetric catastrophe than a uterine rupture resulting in\\nmaternal and/or fetal death. In fact, there appears to be a trend back toward the belief of “once a\\ncaesarean, always a caesarean.” Suffice it to say, “once a caesarean, always a controversy.”\\nIn general, patients who are the most suitable candidates for trial of labor after caesarean section\\n(TOLAC) are those (1) with 1 prior low-transverse caesarean section, (2) who present in labor, (3)\\nwith nonrecurring conditions (eg, breech, abnormal fetal heart rate patterns, placenta previa in prior\\npregnancy), and (4) with a prior vaginal delivery. Patients who are not candidates for a TOLAC\\ninclude women with a prior classical (vertical) uterine incision or prior myomectomy. If a trial of\\nlabor is to be conducted, the patient must be placed on continuous fetal heart rate and uterine activity\\nmonitoring, and a dedicated obstetrician and anesthesiologist must be immediately available to\\nintervene in case uterine rupture is suspected. Prostaglandins for cervical ripening must be avoided,\\nand oxytocin must be used in a judicious and conservative fashion, if at all. Current studies cite a\\nmaternal mortality rate of close to 1% in cases of uterine rupture and a perinatal mortality rate of\\napproximately 50% in association with uterine rupture. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that\\nequipment for both maternal and electronic fetal monitoring and appropriate obstetric and neonatal\\nfacilities are available. A large-bore intravenous catheter must be used, and blood for possible\\nmaternal transfusion must be available. Appropriate anesthesia, a fully equipped operating room, and\\nobstetric and neonatal staff experienced in emergency care must all be immediately available.\\nCephalopelvic Disproportion/Dystocia'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Cases in which the fetal head is too large to traverse the pelvis should be managed by caesarean\\nsection. As discussed earlier, if the head does not engage during labor, operative vaginal delivery\\nshould not be attempted. Rather, caesarean section must be performed. Inlet disproportion should be\\nsuspected in the primigravida if the patient begins labor with the fetal head unengaged. In a significant\\nnumber of these patients, the fetal head fails to engage, and caesarean section is indicated. Midpelvic\\ndisproportion may be suspected if the anteroposterior diameter is short, the ischial spines are\\nprominent, the sacrospinous ligament is short, and the fetus is large. Outlet disproportion usually\\nrequires a trial of forceps or vacuum before a safe vaginal delivery is determined to be impossible.\\nDystocia literally means “difficult labor.” This occurs when a patient’s labor progresses and then\\neither stops completely (arrests) or becomes prolonged (protracted). When either of these situations\\noccurs during labor, the patient warrants careful reassessment, including evaluation of the labor\\npattern, contraction pattern, estimated fetal weight and fetal presentation, and evaluation of the pelvis.\\nIn other words, the 3 P’s (power, passenger, and pelvis) must be adequate in order for a vaginal\\ndelivery to occur.\\nAbnormal Fetal Lie & Malpresentation\\nTransverse lie and breech presentations are common indications for caesarean section. The trend\\ntoward caesarean delivery for breech deliveries has been hastened by a large randomized trial\\ncomparing breech infants born vaginally versus those born by caesarean section; better outcomes were\\nachieved after caesarean section. Although some still \\nconsider vaginal breech delivery to be an\\nacceptable option, experience with the technique is largely disappearing from practice. External\\ncephalic version is a reasonable alternative for some patients and can be attempted to convert the fetus\\nto cephalic presentation. However, this procedure is successful in allowing vaginal birth in only 50%\\nof cases.\\nFetal Heart Rate Tracing Abnormalities\\nFetal monitoring before and during labor may disclose fetal problems that otherwise would not be\\nevident. As a result of continuous fetal monitoring, the number of caesarean sections performed for a\\n“nonreassuring fetal status” has increased. Best estimates demonstrate that approximately 10% of\\ncaesarean sections are performed for this indication.\\nOther Indications\\nIn addition to the indications discussed earlier, other conditions that may lead to caesarean section are\\nplacenta previa, preeclampsia–eclampsia if remote from term, placental abruption, multiple\\ngestations, fetal abnormalities (eg, hydrocephalus), cervical cancer, and active genital herpes\\ninfection. One other indication that is becoming more prevalent is patient choice. The idea of primary\\nelective caesarean section continues to increase in popularity and generate controversy.\\nPREOPERATIVE PREPARATION FOR CAESAREAN SECTION\\nThe following steps are generally taken before caesarean section is performed. The patient is made\\naware of the indications for the caesarean section, the alternatives, and the potential risks, benefits,\\nand complications. She then signs a form indicating that she has received the appropriate information\\nand consents to the procedure (“informed consent”). An intravenous 18-gauge needle should be in\\nplace with an appropriate intravenous solution running before the operation begins. The patient is\\ngiven an antacid to minimize the likelihood of aspiration during anesthesia. A Foley catheter is placed'),\n",

Anesthesia is administered,\\nand the abdomen is prepped. The patient is covered with sterile drapes. Tilting the patient slightly to\\nthe left moves the uterus to the left of the midline and minimizes pressure on the inferior vena cava.\\nOPERATIVE PROCEDURE\\nAbdominal Incision\\nOpinions differ regarding the type of abdominal incision that should be performed. Most obstetricians\\nuse the transverse (Pfannenstiel) incision with or without transection of the rectus muscles because\\nwound dehiscence is rare and because the cosmetic result is usually better. In cases in which the\\ncaesarean section must be performed urgently or emergently, especially in patients with prior\\nabdominal surgery or marked obesity, the midline vertical suprapubic incision is preferred because it\\nis much quicker and the exposure for expeditious delivery and resolving uterine bleeding (by\\nhysterectomy, if needed) usually is better. In the presence of a prior lower abdominal scar, it is\\nimportant to enter the peritoneal cavity at the upper end of the incision to avoid entering the bladder,\\nwhich may have been pulled upward on the abdominal wall at the time of closure of the previous\\nincision.\\nUterine Incision\\nBefore the uterine incision is made, laparotomy pads that have been soaked in warm saline and wrung\\nout can be placed on either side of the uterus to catch the spill of amniotic fluid. The degree of\\ndextrorotation should also be determined by noting the position of the round ligaments so that the\\nuterine incision will be centered. Torsion should not be corrected; instead, access to the midline\\nshould be obtained by retracting the abdominal wall to the patient’s right. The different types of\\nuterine incisions will be discussed later.\\nEncountering the Placenta\\nIf the placenta is encountered beneath the uterine incision, the operator should avoid cutting through\\nit; otherwise serious fetal bleeding may result. If the placenta cannot be avoided, an incision can be\\nmade through it. However, the baby must be delivered as quickly as possible and the cord clamped\\nimmediately to prevent significant blood loss.\\nDelivery\\nThe operator delivers the baby, and then the placenta delivers. Recent evidence has demonstrated that\\nblood loss can be minimized by massaging the uterus to allow for spontaneous placental expulsion\\nrather than by manually separating and extracting the placenta. After delivery of the placenta, the\\nuterus should be massaged and oxytocin administered in a dilute intravenous solution at a rate\\nsufficient to maintain a firm contraction. The uterine cavity is wiped clean with a sponge so as to\\nremove any retained membranes. The uterus is exteriorized, and active bleeding sinuses are clamped\\nwith either Pennington clamps or ring forceps.\\nClosure of the Uterine Incision\\nThe closure of the uterine incision is dependent on the type of incision that is made. In general, the\\nentire thickness of the myometrium should be closed. In order to potentially decrease the likelihood of\\nuterine rupture during a subsequent pregnancy, the uterine incision should be closed in 2 layers. The 2'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='types of uterine incisions used most often and discussed here are the classical uterine incision and the\\nlow-transverse uterine incision.\\nCLASSICAL CAESAREAN SECTION\\nThis is the simplest to perform. However, it is associated with the greatest loss of blood and with a\\ngreater risk of uterine rupture with subsequent pregnancies when compared with low-transverse\\nincisions. The currently accepted indications for classical caesarean section are placenta previa,\\ntransverse lie (especially back down), and preterm delivery in which the lower uterine segment is\\npoorly developed. A classical caesarean section may be preferred if extremely rapid delivery is\\nneeded, because this type of incision may offer the fastest means of delivering the baby. Nonetheless,\\nthe hazards of this procedure must be weighed against the additional minute or so needed to dissect\\nthe bladder away from the lower uterine segment and make the transverse semilunar low-transverse\\nuterine incision.\\nIn performing a classical procedure, a vertical incision is made in the body of the uterus. A scalpel\\nis used to enter the uterine activity, and the incision is enlarged with bandage scissors. The fetus is\\ndelivered through the incision. After the placenta and membranes are removed, the uterine defect is\\nrepaired with 3 layers of running, interlocking absorbable suture. Number 0 suture is recommended\\nfor the 2 deeper layers, and 2-0 suture is used for the superficial layer to reap-proximate the serosal\\nedges.\\nLOW-TRANSVERSE CAESAREAN SECTION\\nBecause the low-transverse uterine incision (\\nFigs. 20–10\\n through \\n20–17\\n) is associated with less blood\\nloss and the risk of subsequent uterine rupture is less than with a classical caesarean section, this type\\nof caesarean delivery is performed more frequently. After the peritoneal cavity is opened and the\\nuterus identified, the bladder fold of peritoneum is picked up with tissue forceps and incised\\ntransversely. The bladder is bluntly separated from the anterior aspect of the uterus inferiorly for a\\ndistance of 3–4 cm. The bladder is held away from this area by a specially designed bladder retractor.\\nA transverse incision is made through the anterior uterine wall with the scalpel. Using either bandage\\nscissors or fingers, the transverse incision is extended in a semilunar fashion and extended superiorly\\nat the lateral edges in order to avoid the uterine vessels.'),\n",

If the head is located deep in the pelvis, the head can safely be pushed up by an assistant\\ninserting a hand into the vagina to elevate the fetal head for ease of delivery. After the baby and\\nplacenta are delivered, the uterus is exteriorized and clamps are placed on the cut edges of the uterus\\nin areas of significant bleeding from the uterine sinuses. The uterine incision is generally closed in 2\\nlayers using number 0 chromic catgut or other absorbable suture. After adequate hemostasis has been\\nachieved, the bladder peritoneum either is reapproximated with suture or is left in place. Before the\\nuterus is returned to the peritoneal cavity, the adnexa should be inspected for the presence of any\\npathology, such as ovarian cysts. Some practitioners prefer to close the anterior peritoneum with\\nabsorbable suture, whereas others prefer to leave it alone. The fascia, subcutaneous tissue, and skin are\\nreapproximated in standard fashion.\\nCOMPLICATIONS\\nThe most common complications that result from caesarean section are postpartum hemorrhage,\\nendometritis, and wound infection. Administering prophylactic antibiotics and ensuring hemostasis\\nprior to closure of the abdomen have helped decrease the incidence of these complications. New data\\nare emerging that demonstrate a lower risk of endometritis when antibiotics are given prior to the skin\\nincision when compared to after clamping of the umbilical cord. The major factors affecting healing\\nof the uterine incision are hemostasis, accuracy of apposition, quality and amount of suture material,\\nand avoidance of infection and tissue strangulation.

Some clearly are not preventable. Others are the direct result of faulty\\nsurgical technique, especially lack of attention to hemostasis, inept or ill-chosen anesthesia,\\ninadequate blood \\nproduct replacement or transfusion of mismatched blood, and delayed diagnosis or\\nmismanagement of infection.\\nUnfortunately, little information about the integrity of a particular scar in a subsequent pregnancy'),\n",

In a later pregnancy, pain in the area of the scar may suggest dehiscence. Approximately\\n50% of all ruptures of classical uterine scars occur before the onset of labor. The incidence of uterine\\nrupture is approximately 4–9% of classical scars and 0.7–1.5% of low-transverse scars. Rupture of a\\nclassical scar usually is catastrophic, occurring suddenly, totally, and with partial or total extrusion of\\nthe fetus into the abdominal cavity. Shock due to internal hemorrhage is a prominent sign. Rupture of\\nthe low-transverse scar usually is more subtle and almost always occurs during active labor. The most\\ncommon presenting sign (present in more than 80% of cases) is a change in the fetal heart rate pattern.\\nA newly recognized finding of variable or late decelerations should alert the obstetrician. Additional\\nfindings that might signal uterine rupture include vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain (especially over\\nthe prior incision site), and loss of fetal station. A scalp electrode to ensure a continuous fetal heart\\nrate tracing should be utilized as soon as possible in \\npatients who are undergoing TOLAC. If uterine\\nrupture is suspected, the patient must undergo surgery as soon as possible.\\nPERINATAL MORBIDITY & MORTALITY\\nAlthough it may appear on the surface that caesarean delivery is the safest for the baby, this may not\\nbe entirely true. Although usually benign, transient tachypnea of the newborn is more common with\\ncaesarean section than with vaginal delivery. The risk of fetal hemorrhage and hypoxia is present\\nwhen the placenta is encountered below the uterine incision and is inadvertently or purposely\\ntransected. There is also the potential risk for laceration of the baby at the time that the uterine\\nincision is made. Fetal laceration is reported to occur on an infrequent basis at a rate of approximately\\n0.2–0.4% of all caesarean sections. The usual site is on the face, in the area of the cheek, but it may\\nalso occur on the buttock, ear, head, or any other body site under the incision. Therefore, it is of great\\nimportance that care is taken when incising the layers of the uterus. This is especially true in a\\nprolonged labor, in which the uterus may be very thin. Because of the potential complications to the\\nbaby inherent with each caesarean section, each infant should be examined by a trained professional as\\nsoon as possible after delivery.\\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \\nVaginal Birth after Previous Cesarean\\nDelivery.

The most common\\nreason for performing caesarean hysterectomy is abnormal placental implantation, such as placenta\\naccreta, increta, and percreta. As the caesarean section rate continues to escalate, these complications\\nare becoming more common. Other indications for caesarean hysterectomy include intractable uterine\\natony, inability to repair a ruptured uterus, and large uterine myomas. Caesarean hysterectomy is a\\npotentially morbid procedure because of increased blood loss and potential for injury to the bladder,\\nureter, or bowel.\\nThe technical aspects of hysterectomy at the time of caesarean section are similar to those of\\nhysterectomy in the nonpregnant patient except that all structures, cleavage planes, and pedicles are\\nhighly vascular. Therefore, there is significant risk for excessive blood loss and the need for the\\ntransfusion of blood products.

Poggi, MD\\nPOSTPARTUM HEMORRHAGE\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n Postpartum hemorrhage denotes excessive bleeding (>500 mL in vaginal delivery) following\\ndelivery. Hemorrhage may occur before, during, or after delivery of the placenta. Actual measured\\nblood loss during uncomplicated vaginal deliveries averages 700 mL, and blood loss often may be\\nunderestimated. Nevertheless, the criterion of a 500-mL loss is acceptable on historical grounds.\\n Blood lost during the first 24 hours after delivery is \\nearly postpartum hemorrhage\\n; blood lost\\nbetween 24 hours and 6 weeks after delivery is \\nlate postpartum hemorrhage\\n.\\nPathogenesis\\nThe incidence of excessive blood loss following vaginal delivery is 5–8%. Postpartum hemorrhage is\\nthe most common cause of excessive blood loss in pregnancy, and most transfusions in pregnant\\nwomen are performed to replace blood lost after delivery. Hemorrhage is the third leading cause of\\nmaternal mortality in the United States and is directly responsible for approximately one-sixth of\\nmaternal deaths. In less developed countries, hemorrhage is among the leading obstetric causes of\\nmaternal death.\\nCauses of postpartum hemorrhage include uterine atony, obstetric lacerations, retained placental\\ntissue, and coagulation defects.\\nA. Uterine Atony\\nPostpartum bleeding is physiologically controlled by constriction of interlacing myometrial fibers that\\nsurround the blood vessels supplying the placental implantation site. Uterine atony exists when the\\nmyometrium cannot contract.\\nAtony is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage (50% of cases). Predisposing causes\\ninclude excessive manipulation of the uterus, general anesthesia (particularly with halogenated\\ncompounds), uterine overdistention (twins or polyhydramnios), prolonged labor, grand multi-parity,\\nuterine leiomyomas, operative delivery and intrauterine manipulation, oxytocin induction or\\naugmentation of labor, previous hemorrhage in the third stage, uterine infection, extravasation of\\nblood into the myometrium (Couvelaire uterus), and intrinsic myometrial dysfunction.\\nB. Obstetric Lacerations\\nExcessive bleeding from an episiotomy, lacerations, or both causes approximately 20% of postpartum\\nhemorrhages. Lacerations can involve the uterus, cervix, vagina, or vulva. They usually result from\\nprecipitous or uncontrolled delivery or operative delivery of a large infant; however, they may occur'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='after any delivery. Laceration of blood vessels underneath the vaginal or vulvar epithelium results in\\nhematomas. Bleeding is concealed and can be particularly dangerous because it may go unrecognized\\nfor several hours and become apparent only when shock occurs.\\nEpisiotomies may cause excessive bleeding if they involve arteries or large varicosities, if the\\nepisiotomy is large, or if a delay occurred between episiotomy and delivery or between delivery and\\nrepair of the episiotomy.\\nPersistent bleeding (especially bright red) and a well-contracted, firm uterus suggest bleeding from\\na laceration or from the episiotomy. When cervical or vaginal lacerations are identified as the source\\nof postpartum hemorrhage, repair is best performed with adequate anesthesia.\\nSpontaneous rupture of the uterus is rare. Risk factors for this complication include grand\\nmultiparity, malpresentation, previous uterine surgery, and oxytocin induction of labor. Rupture of a\\nprevious caesarean section scar after \\nvaginal delivery may be an increasingly important cause of\\npostpartum hemorrhage.\\nC. Retained Placental Tissue\\nRetained placental tissue and membranes cause 5–10% of postpartum hemorrhages. Retention of\\nplacental tissue in the uterine cavity occurs in placenta accreta, which is an increasingly frequent\\ndiagnosis in this era of multiple caesarean deliveries. Retained placental tissue may also develop in\\ncases managed by manual removal of the placenta, in mismanagement of the third stage of labor, and\\nin unrecognized succenturiate placenta.\\nUltrasonographic findings of an echogenic uterine mass strongly support a diagnosis of retained\\nplacental products. The technique probably is better used in cases of hemorrhage occurring a few\\nhours after delivery or in late postpartum hemorrhage. Transvaginal duplex Doppler imaging also is\\neffective in evaluating these patients. Some evidence indicates that sonohysterography may aid in the\\ndiagnosis of residual trophoblastic tissue. If the endometrial cavity appears empty, unnecessary\\ndilatation and curettage may be avoided.\\nD. Coagulation Defects\\nCoagulopathies in pregnancy may be acquired coagulation defects seen in association with several\\nobstetric disorders, including abruptio placentae, excess thromboplastin from a retained dead fetus,\\namniotic fluid embolism, severe preeclampsia, eclampsia, and sepsis. These coagulopathies may\\npresent as hypofibrinogenemia, thrombocytopenia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.\\nTransfusion of more than 8 U of blood in itself may induce a dilutional coagulopathy.\\nVon Willebrand’s disease, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, and leukemia may occur in pregnant\\nwomen.\\nPrevention\\nPrevention of hemorrhage is preferable to even the best treatment. All patients in labor should be\\nevaluated for risk of postpartum hemorrhage. Risk factors include coagulopathy, hemorrhage, or blood\\ntransfusion during a previous pregnancy; anemia during labor; grand multiparity; multiple gestation;\\nlarge infant; polyhydramnios; dysfunctional labor; oxytocin induction or augmentation of labor; rapid\\nor tumultuous labor; severe preeclampsia or eclampsia; vaginal delivery after previous caesarean\\nbirth; general anesthesia for delivery; forceps delivery; and delay in placental delivery after vaginal\\ndelivery of the infant.'),\n",

Moreover, other types of treatment for anemia may involve some risk.\\nPostpartum hypotension may lead to partial or total necrosis of the anterior pituitary gland and\\ncause postpartum panhypopituitarism, or Sheehan’s syndrome, which is characterized by failure to\\nlactate, amenorrhea, decreased breast size, loss of pubic and axillary hair, hypothyroidism, and\\nadrenal insufficiency. The condition is rare (<1 in 10,000 deliveries). A woman who has been\\nhypotensive postpartum and who is actively lactating probably does not have Sheehan’s syndrome.\\nHypotension also can lead to acute renal failure and other organ system injury. In extreme\\nhemorrhage, sterility will result from hysterectomy performed to control intractable postpartum\\nhemorrhage.\\nTreatment\\nA. Predelivery Preparation\\nAll obstetric patients should have blood typed and screened on admission. Patients identified as being\\nat risk for postpartum hemorrhage should have their blood typed and cross-matched immediately. The\\nblood should be reserved in the blood bank for 24 hours after delivery. A large-bore intravenous\\ncatheter should be securely taped into place after insertion. Delivery room personnel should be alerted\\nto the risk of hemorrhage. Severely anemic patients should be transfused as soon as cross-matched\\nblood is ready.\\nWith concerns associated with blood transfusion, autologous blood donation in obstetric patients at\\nrisk for postpartum hemorrhage has been advocated. Despite careful evaluation for risk factors, with\\nthe exception of cases of placenta previa, our ability to predict which patients will have hemorrhage\\nand require blood transfusion remains poor; therefore, the cost of such an approach may not be\\njustified.\\nB. Delivery\\nFollowing delivery of the infant, the uterus is massaged in a circular or back-and-forth motion until\\nthe myometrium becomes firm and well contracted. Excessive and vigorous massage of the uterus\\nbefore, during, or after delivery of the placenta may interfere with normal contraction of the\\nmyometrium and, instead of hastening contraction, may lead to excessive postpartum blood loss.\\nC. Third Stage of Normal Labor; Placental Separation\\nThe placenta typically separates from the uterus and is delivered within 5 minutes of delivery of the\\ninfant in 50% of cases and within 15 minutes in 90% of cases. Attempts to speed separation are of no\\nbenefit and may cause harm. \\nSpontaneous placental separation is impending if the uterus becomes\\nround and firm, a sudden gush of blood comes from the vagina, the uterus seems to rise in the\\nabdomen, and the umbilical cord moves down out of the vagina.\\nThe placenta then can be removed from the vagina by gentle traction on the umbilical cord. Prior to\\nplacental separation, gentle steady traction on the cord combined with upward pressure on the lower\\nuterine segment (Brandt-Andrews maneuver) ensures that the placenta can be removed as soon as\\nseparation occurs and provides a means of monitoring the consistency of the uterus.

The placenta is inspected for\\ncompleteness immediately after delivery.\\nManual Removal of the Placenta\\nOpinion is divided about the timing of manual removal of the placenta. In the presence of hemorrhage,\\nit is unreasonable to wait for spontaneous separation, and manual removal of the placenta should be\\nundertaken without delay. Traditionally, in the absence of bleeding, many have advocated removal of\\nthe placenta 30 minutes after delivery of the infant. Newer evidence suggests that to prevent\\npostpartum hemorrhage, a placenta that has not been delivered by 18 minutes should be removed.\\nEfforts to promote routine manual removal of the placenta were often made in the past. The\\nrationale includes shortening the third stage of labor, decreasing blood loss, developing experience in\\nmanual removal as practice for dealing with placenta accreta, and providing a way to simultaneously\\nexplore the uterus. Evidence now indicates that manual removal of the placenta may be a risk factor\\nfor postpartum endometritis. These real or potential benefits must be weighed against the discomfort\\ncaused to the patient, the risk of infection, and the risk of causing more bleeding by interfering with\\nnormal mechanisms of placental separation.\\nTechnique\\n: The uterus is stabilized by grasping the fundus with a hand placed over the abdomen.\\nThe other hand traces the course of the umbilical cord through the vagina and cervix into the uterus to\\npalpate the edge of the placenta. The membranes at the placental margin are perforated, and the hand\\nis inserted between the placenta and the uterine wall, palmar side toward the placenta. The hand is\\nthen gently swept from side to side and up and down to peel the placenta from its attachments to the\\nuterus. When the placenta has been completely separated from the uterus, it is grasped and pulled\\nfrom the uterus.\\nThe fetal and maternal sides of the placenta should be inspected to ensure that it has been removed\\nin its entirety. On the fetal surface, incomplete placental removal is manifested as interruption of the\\nvessels on the chorionic plate, usually shown by hemorrhage. On the maternal surface, it is possible to\\nsee where cotyledons have been detached. If evidence of incomplete removal is observed, the uterus\\nmust be re-explored and any small pieces of adherent placenta removed. The uterus should be\\nmassaged until a firm myometrial tone is achieved. Depending on the patient’s other risk factors for\\npostpartum endometritis, prophylactic antibiotics can be given at the time of manual removal of the\\nplacenta.\\nImmediate Postpartum Period\\nUterotonic agents can be administered as soon as the infant’s anterior shoulder is delivered. There is a\\nsignificantly lowered incidence of postpartum hemorrhage in patients receiving oxytocin (either low-\\ndose intravenous [IV] or intramuscular [IM]) at the time of delivery of the anterior shoulder and\\ncontrolled cord traction compared to patients receiving IV oxytocin after placental delivery. There\\nwas no greater incidence of placental retention. However, populations without ultrasound screening\\nfor twins have a potential risk for entrapment of an undiagnosed second twin, and oxytocin should\\nonly be given after placental delivery. Routine administration of oxytocics during the third stage\\nreduces the blood loss of delivery and decreases the chances of postpartum hemorrhage by 40%.\\nOxytocin, 10–20 U/L of isotonic saline, or other IV solution by slow IV infusion or 10 U IM can be\\nused. Bolus administration should not be used because large doses (>5 U) can cause hypotension.\\nRecently, sublingual misoprostol (800 μg) has been found to be clinically as effective as oxytocin (40\\nU/L) for treatment of postpartum hemorrhage.

Ergot alkaloids (eg, methylergonovine maleate 0.2 mg IM) also can be routinely used,\\nbut they are not more effective than oxytocin and pose more risk because they rarely cause marked\\nhypertension. This occurs most commonly with IV administration or when regional anesthesia is used.\\nErgot alkaloids should not be used in hypertensive women or in women with cardiac disease.\\nRepair of Lacerations\\nIf bleeding is excessive before placental separation, manual removal of the placenta is indicated.\\nOtherwise, excessive manipulation of the uterus should be avoided.\\nThe vagina and cervix should be carefully inspected immediately after delivery of the placenta,\\nwith adequate lighting and assistants available. The episiotomy is quickly repaired after massage has\\nproduced a firm, tightly contracted uterus. A pack placed in the vagina above the episiotomy helps to\\nkeep the field dry; attaching the free end of the pack to the adjacent drapes reminds the operator to\\nremove it after the repair is completed.\\nThe tendency of bleeding vessels to retract from the laceration site is the reason for one of the\\ncardinal principles of repair. Begin the repair above the highest extent of \\nthe laceration. The highest\\nsuture is also used to provide gentle traction to bring the laceration site closer to the introitus.\\nHemostatic ligatures are then placed in the usual manner, and the entire birth canal is carefully\\ninspected to ensure that no additional bleeding sites are present. Extensive inspection also provides\\ntime to confirm that prior hemostatic efforts have been effective.\\nA cervical or vaginal laceration extending into the broad ligament should not be repaired vaginally.\\nLaparotomy with evacuation of the resultant hematoma and hemostatic repair or hysterectomy are\\nrequired.\\nLarge or expanding hematomas of the vaginal walls require operative management for proper\\ncontrol. The vaginal wall is first exposed by an assistant. If a laceration accompanies the hematoma,\\nthe laceration is extended so that the hematoma can be completely evacuated and explored. When the\\nbleeding site is identified, a large hemostatic ligature can be placed well above the site. This ensures\\nhemostasis in the vessel, which is likely to retract when lacerated. The hematoma cavity should be left\\nopen to allow drainage of blood and ensure that bleeding will not be concealed if hemostasis cannot be\\nachieved.\\nIf no laceration is present on the vaginal side wall when a hematoma is identified, then an incision\\nmust be made over the hematoma to allow treatment to proceed as outlined.\\nFollowing delivery, recovery room attendants should frequently massage the uterus and check for\\nvaginal bleeding.\\nEvaluation of Persistent Bleeding\\nIf vaginal bleeding persists after delivery of the placenta, aggressive treatment should be initiated. It\\nis not sufficient to perform perfunctory uterine massage, for instance, without searching for the cause\\nof the bleeding and initiating definitive treatment.

Completely inspect the cervix and vagina.\\n8. Insert a second IV catheter for administration of blood or fluids.\\nA. Measures to Control Bleeding\\n1. Manual exploration of the uterus\\n—The uterus should be explored immediately in women with\\npostpartum hemorrhage. Manual exploration also should be considered after delivery of the placenta\\nin the following circumstances: (1) when vaginal delivery follows previous caesarean section; (2)\\nwhen intrauterine manipulation, such as version and extraction, has been performed; (3) when\\nmalpresentation has occurred during labor and delivery; (4) when a premature infant has been\\ndelivered; (5) when an abnormal uterine contour has been noted prior to delivery; and (6) when there\\nis a possibility of undiagnosed multiple pregnancy—to rule out twins.\\nEnsure that all placental parts have been delivered and that the uterus is intact. This should be done\\neven in the case of a well-contracted uterus. Exploration performed for reasons other than evaluation\\nof hemorrhage also should confirm that the uterine wall is intact and should attempt to identify any\\npossible intrauterine structural abnormalities. Manual exploration of the uterus does not increase\\nfebrile morbidity or blood loss.\\nTechnique\\n: Place a fresh glove over the glove on the exploring hand. Form the hand into a cone\\nand gently introduce it by firm pressure through the cervix while stabilizing the fundus with the other\\nhand. Sweep the backs of the first and second fingers across the entire surface of the uterus, beginning\\nat the fundus. In the lower uterine segment, palpate the walls with the palmar surface of 1 finger.\\nUterine lacerations will be felt as an obvious anatomic defect. All exploration should be gentle\\nbecause the postpartum uterus is easily perforated.\\nUterine rupture detected by manual exploration in the presence of postpartum hemorrhage requires\\nimmediate laparotomy. A decision to repair the defect or proceed with hysterectomy is made on the\\nbasis of the extent of the rupture, the patient’s desire for future childbearing, and the degree of the\\npatient’s clinical deterioration.\\n2. Bimanual compression & massage\\n—The most important step in controlling atonic postpartum\\nhemorrhage is immediate bimanual uterine compression, which may have to be continued for 20–30\\nminutes or more. Fluid replacement should begin as soon as a secure IV line is in place. Typed and\\ncross-matched blood is given when it is available. Manual compression of the uterus will control most\\ncases of hemorrhage due to uterine atony, retained products of conception (once the products are\\nremoved), and coagulopathies.\\nTechnique\\n: Place a hand on the patient’s abdomen and grasp the uterine fundus; bring it down over\\nthe symphysis pubis. Insert the other hand into the vagina, and place the first and second fingers on\\neither side of the cervix and push it cephalad and anteriorly. The pulsating uterine arteries should be\\nfelt by the fingertips. Massage the uterus with both hands while maintaining compression. Prolonged\\ncompression (20–30 minutes) may be required but almost always is successful in controlling bleeding.\\nInsert a Foley catheter into the bladder during compression and massage because vigorous fluid and\\nblood replacement will cause diuresis. A distended bladder will interfere with compression and\\nmassage, will contribute to the patient’s discomfort, and may itself be a major contributor to uterine\\natony.\\n3. Curettage\\n—Curettage of a large, soft postpartum uterus can be a formidable undertaking because'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='the risk of perforation is high and the procedure commonly results in increased rather than decreased\\nbleeding. The suction curette, even with a large cannula, covers only a small area of the postpartum\\nuterus, and its size and shape increase the likelihood of perforation. A large blunt curette, the “banjo”\\ncurette, probably is the safest instrument for curettage of the postpartum uterus. It can be used when\\nmanual exploration fails to remove fragments of adherent placenta.\\nCurettage should be delayed unless bleeding cannot be controlled by compression and massage\\nalone. Overly vigorous puerperal curettage can result in focal complete removal of the endometrium,\\nparticularly if the uterus is infected, with subsequent healing characterized by formation of adhesions\\nand \\nAsherman’s syndrome\\n (amenorrhea and secondary sterility due to intrauterine adhesions and\\nuterine synechiae). If circumstances permit, ultrasonic evaluation of the postpartum uterus may\\ndistinguish those patients who will benefit from curettage from those who should be managed without\\nit.\\n4. Uterine packing\\n—Although once widely used for control of obstetric hemorrhage, uterine packing\\nis no longer favored. The uterus may expand to considerable size after delivery of the placenta, thus\\naccommodating both a large volume of packing material and a large volume of blood. The technique\\nalso demands considerable technical expertise because the uterus must be packed uniformly with 5\\nyards of 4-inch gauze, sometimes with the aid of special instrumentation (Torpin packer). However,\\nthis method has been used successfully, avoiding conversion to laparotomy in 9 reported cases. As a\\nlast resort, uterine packing may be particularly appropriate in centers where an interventional\\nradiologist is not immediately available.\\nAn alternative for uterine packing that relies on the same principle of uterine tamponade is the\\nBakri balloon. This device is an inflatable balloon that inflates up to 800 mL. Due to a double lumen\\nport, drainage of blood can still occur so that concealed hemorrhage does not occur. The balloon can\\neasily be moved after deflation vaginally. An advantage of the device is that it can be inserted at time\\nof hemorrhage from a vaginal approach or at time of laparotomy; in either case, it can be removed\\nvaginally. The success of the device has been described in case series.\\n5. Uterotonic agents\\n—Oxytocin 20–40 U/L of crystalloid should be infused, if not already running, at\\na rate of 10–15 mL/min. Methylergonovine 0.2 mg can be given IM but is contraindicated if the\\npatient is hypertensive. Intramyometrial injection of prostaglandin F\\n2α\\n (PGF\\n2α\\n) to control bleeding\\nwas initially described in 1976. Intravaginal or rectal prostaglandin suppositories, intrauterine\\nirrigation with prostaglandins, and intramyome-trial injection of prostaglandins also have been\\nreported to control hemorrhage from uterine atony. IM administration of 15-methylprostaglandin\\nanalogue was successful in treating 85% of patients with postpartum hemorrhage due to atony.\\nFailures in these series occurred in women who had uterine infections or unrecognized placenta\\naccreta. Side effects usually are minimal but may include transient oxygen desaturation,\\nbronchospasm, and, rarely, significant hypertension. Transient fever and diarrhea may occur. Rectal\\nmisoprostol (800 μg), a prostaglandin E\\n1\\n analogue, has been found to be effective in the treatment of\\nprimary postpartum hemorrhage secondary to atony. As mentioned earlier, sublingual misoprostol\\n(800 μg) has been found to be clinically as effective as oxytocin (40 U/L) for treatment of postpartum\\nhemorrhage due to atony. This information is particularly useful for low-resource areas because\\nmisoprostol does not have to be refrigerated or require specialized equipment for administration.\\n6. Radiographic embolization of pelvic vessels\\n—Embolization of pelvic and uterine vessels by\\nangiographic techniques is increasingly common and has success rates that range from 85–95% in\\nexperienced hands.

With the patient under local\\nanesthesia, a catheter is placed in the aorta and fluoroscopy is used to identify the bleeding vessel.\\nPieces of absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam) or coil are injected into the damaged vessel (most\\ntypically the uterine artery) or into the internal iliac vessels if no specific site of bleeding can be\\nidentified. If bleeding continues, further embolization can be performed. This technique has the\\nadvantage of being effective even when the cause of hemorrhage is extrauterine and in the presence or\\nabsence of uterine atony. Many authors recommend embolization before internal iliac ligation,\\nbecause ligation obstructs the access route for angiography. Adequate recanalization can occur to\\nmaintain fertility, although at this point, there are only limited case series demonstrating maintenance\\nof fertility with pelvic artery embolization in this setting (as opposed to use for uterine fibroids).\\nAlthough pelvic artery embolization is clearly preferable to hysterectomy in a patient desiring\\nfertility, it is important to remember that the procedure does have an inherent complication rate, about\\n3–5%, with reports in the medical literature of loss of circulation to the lower extremities, labial and\\nbuttock necrosis, and vesicovaginal fistula.\\n7. Operative management\\n—The patient’s wishes regarding further childbearing should be made\\nclear as soon as laparotomy is contemplated for the management of postpartum hemorrhage. If the\\npatient’s wishes cannot be ascertained, the operator should assume that the childbearing function is to\\nbe retained. Whenever possible, the spouse or family members should also be consulted prior to\\nlaparotomy.\\nA\\n. P\\nRESSURE OCCLUSION OF THE AORTA\\n—Immediate temporary control of pelvic bleeding may be\\nobtained at laparotomy by pressure occlusion of the aorta, which will provide valuable time to treat\\nhypotension, obtain experienced \\nassistants, identify the source of bleeding, and plan the operative\\nprocedure. In the young and otherwise healthy patient, pressure occlusion can be maintained for\\nseveral minutes without permanent sequelae.\\nB\\n. U\\nTERINE ARTERY LIGATION\\n—During pregnancy, 90% of the blood flow to the uterus is supplied by\\nthe uterine arteries. Direct ligation of these easily accessible vessels can successfully control\\nhemorrhage in 75–90% of cases, particularly when the bleeding is uterine in origin. Recanalization\\ncan occur, and subsequent pregnancies have been reported.\\nTechnique\\n: The uterus is lifted upward and away from the side to be ligated. Absorbable suture on\\na large needle is placed around the ascending uterine artery and vein on 1 side of the uterus, passing\\nthrough the myometrium 2–4 cm medial to the vessels and through the avascular area of the broad\\nligament. The suture includes the myometrium to fix the suture and to avoid tearing the vessels. The\\nsame procedure is then performed on the opposite side. If the ligation is performed during caesarean\\nsection, the sutures can be placed just below the uterine incision under the bladder flap. It is not\\nnecessary to mobilize the bladder otherwise. Bilateral utero-ovarian artery ligation can also be\\nperformed in an attempt to reduce blood flow to the uterus. This technique should be performed with\\nabsorbable suture near the point of anastomoses between the ovarian artery and the ascending uterine\\nartery at the utero-ovarian ligament.\\nC\\n. B-\\nLYNCH BRACE SUTURE\\n—An alternative to the vessel ligation techniques is placement of a brace\\nsuture to compress the uterus in cases of diffuse bleeding from atony or percreta (\\nFig. 21–1\\n). This\\ntechnique, initially described in 1997, and in multiple small cases series since, has become increasing\\npopular due to the simplicity of the procedure.'),\n",

B-Lynch brace suture\\nTechnique\\n: Laparotomy is made in the standard way for caesarean section, and a low-transverse\\nuterine incision is made after the bladder is taken down. The uterus is exteriorized. To test the\\neffectiveness of the method, the uterus is compressed manually, and another operator checks the\\nvagina for decreased bleeding. Using no. 2 catgut, the uterus is punctured 3 cm from the right lower\\nincision and 3 cm from the right lateral border. The suture is threaded to emerge 3 cm above the upper\\nincision margin and 4 cm from the lateral border. The catgut is now visible anteriorly as it is passed\\nover to compress the uterine fundus approximately 34 cm from the right cornual border. The suture is\\nfed posteriorly and vertically to enter the posterior wall of the uterine cavity at the same level as the\\nprevious entry point. After manual compression, the suture is tightened and then passed posteriorly on\\nthe left side and passed around the uterine fundus again, this time on the left. The suture is brought\\nanteriorly to puncture the uterus at the upper part of the left uterine incision and then reemerge below\\nthe lower incision in a symmetric fashion.

Massive transfusions may be necessary in patients with severe hemorrhage.\\nComponent therapy is advocated, with transfusion of packed cells, platelets, fresh-frozen plasma, and\\ncryoprecipitate when indicated. Blood products should be obtained and given without delay when\\nneeded, because postponing transfusion may only contribute to the development of disseminated\\nintravascular coagulation. In specialized settings, there may be a role for off-label use of recombinant\\nactivated factor VII, which was originally developed for hemophilia patients, but has been used\\nsuccessfully in several cases of fulminant postpartum hemorrhage.\\nB. Management of Delayed Postpartum Hemorrhage\\nDelayed postpartum hemorrhage (bleeding ≥2 weeks after delivery) is almost always due to\\nsubinvolution of the placental bed or retained placental fragments. Involution of the placental site is\\nnormally delayed when compared with that of the rest of the endometrium. However, for unknown\\nreasons, in subinvolution the adjacent endometrium and the decidua basalis have not regenerated to\\ncover the placental implantation site. The involutional processes of thrombosis and hyalinization have\\nfailed to occur in the underlying blood vessels, so bleeding may occur with only minimal trauma or\\nother (unknown) stimuli. Although the cause of subinvolution is unknown, faulty placental\\nimplantation, implantation in the poorly vascularized lower uterine segment, and persistent infection\\nat the implantation site have been suggested as possible factors. Uterine compression and bimanual\\nmassage, as previously described, control this type of bleeding, but it may be necessary to continue\\ncompression and massage for 30–45 minutes or longer. As previously mentioned, transvaginal\\nultrasound may aid in diagnosis of retained placental products. If imaging studies suggest\\nintracavitary tissue, curettage is warranted.\\nBroad-spectrum antibiotics should be started when resuscitation allows.

Histologic examination of the placental implantation site\\nusually demonstrates the absence of the decidua and Nitabuch’s layer. Cases of placenta accreta have\\nbeen seen in the first trimester, suggesting that the process may occur at the time of implantation and\\nnot later in gestation.\\nAlthough the exact cause is unknown, several clinical situations are associated with placenta\\naccreta, such as previous caesarean section, placenta previa, grand multiparity, previous uterine\\ncurettage, and previously treated Asherman’s syndrome.\\nThese conditions share a common possible defect in formation of the decidua basalis. The\\nincidence of placenta accreta in the presence of placenta previa after 1 prior uterine incision is\\nbetween 14% and 24%, after 2 is 23–48%, and after 3 is 35–50%. The incidence of placenta accreta\\nafter successful treatment of Asherman’s syndrome may be as high as 15%.\\nClinical Findings\\nAdverse effects from placenta accreta in pregnancy or during the course of labor and delivery are\\nuncommon. Rarely, intraabdominal hemorrhage or placental invasion of adjacent organs prior to labor\\nhas occurred, with the diagnosis made at laparotomy.\\nThe diagnosis of placenta increta prior to delivery based on the lack of the sonolucent area\\nnormally seen beneath the implantation site during ultrasonographic examination is a finding\\nconfirmed in several reports. Sonographic antenatal diagnosis of the less invasive placental accreta\\nalso has been reported. Color Doppler imaging appears to be particularly helpful in diagnosis.\\nMagnetic resonance imaging has also aided in the diagnosis of placenta accreta. The diagnosis is more\\noften established when no plane of cleavage is found between the placenta or parts of the placenta and\\nthe myometrium in the presence of postpartum hemorrhage. Retained placental parts prevent the\\nmyometrium from contracting and thereby achieving hemostasis. Bleeding can be brisk. Inspection of\\nthe already separated placenta shows that portions are missing, and manual exploration may produce\\nadditional placental fragments.\\nDelayed spontaneous separation of the placenta is also an indication of an unusually adherent\\nplacenta. Focal or partial involvement may be manifested as difficulty in establishing a cleavage plane\\nduring manual removal of the placenta. Removal of a totally adherent placenta is difficult. Persistent\\nefforts to manually remove a totally adherent placenta are futile and waste time, and they result in\\neven more blood loss. Preparation for hysterectomy should begin as soon as the diagnosis is\\nsuspected.\\nComplications\\nThe immediate morbidity associated with an abnormally adherent placenta is that associated with any\\ntype of postpartum hemorrhage. Massive blood loss and hypotension can occur. Intrauterine\\nmanipulation necessary to diagnose and treat placenta accreta may result in uterine perforation and\\ninfection.

One worker reported\\nno inversions in more than 10,000 personally conducted deliveries. More recent reviews indicate a\\ngreater incidence of uterine inversion, approximately 1 in 2000 to 1 in 2500 deliveries.\\nThe exact cause of uterine inversion is unknown, and the condition is not always preventable. The\\ncervix must be dilated, and the uterine fundus must be relaxed for inversion to occur. Rapid uterine\\nemptying may contribute to uterine relaxation.\\nConditions that may predispose women to uterine inversion include fundal implantation of the\\nplacenta, abnormal adherence of the placenta (partial placenta accreta), congenital or acquired\\nweakness of the myometrium, uterine anomalies, protracted labor, previous uterine inversion,\\nintrapartum therapy with magnesium sulfate, strong traction exerted on the umbilical cord, and fundal\\npressure.\\nPrevention\\nMany cases of uterine inversion result from mismanagement of the third stage of labor in women who\\nalready are at risk for developing uterine inversion. The following maneuvers are to be avoided:\\nexcessive traction on the umbilical cord, excessive fundal pressure, excessive intraabdominal\\npressure, and excessively vigorous manual removal of the placenta.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe diagnosis of uterine inversion usually is obvious. Shock and hemorrhage are prominent, as is\\nconsiderable pain. A dark red–blue bleeding mass is palpable and often visible at the cervix, in the\\nvagina, or outside the vagina. A depression in the uterine fundus or even an absent fundus is noted on\\nabdominal examination. Partial inversion in which the fundus stays within the vagina can escape\\nimmediate notice if the attendant is not aware of this complication.\\nIf the uterus is inverted but does not protrude through the cervix, the inversion is \\nincomplete\\n. In\\ncomplete\\n inversion, the fundus has prolapsed through the cervix. Occasionally, the entire uterus may\\nprolapse out of the vagina.\\nPuerperal inversion has also been classified on the basis of its duration. Acute inversion occurs\\nimmediately after delivery and before the cervix constricts. Once the cervix constricts, the inversion is\\ntermed \\nsubacute\\n. Chronic inversion is noted more than 4 weeks after delivery. Today, nearly all cases\\nof uterine inversion are of the acute variety and are recognized and treated immediately after delivery.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nIn some cases, a prolapsed fibroid may have clinical findings similar to uterine inversion; however,\\nwith a prolapsed fibroid, the uterine fundus should be palpable on abdominal examination.\\nComplications\\nThe morbidity and mortality associated with uterine inversion correlate with the degree of\\nhemorrhage, the rapidity of diagnosis, and the effectiveness of treatment.\\nThe immediate morbidity is that associated with any postpartum hemorrhage; however,\\nendomyometritis frequently follows uterine inversion.

Manual Repositioning of the Uterus\\nTreatment should begin as soon as the diagnosis of uterine inversion is made. Assistance is vital. An\\ninitial attempt should be made to reposition the fundus. The inverted fundus, along with the placenta if\\nit is still attached, is slowly and steadily pushed upward in the axis of the uterus (\\nFig. 21–3\\n). If the\\nplacenta has not separated, do not remove it until an adequate IV infusion has been established.\\nFigure 21–3\\n. Replacement of an inverted uterus.\\nIf the initial attempt fails, induce general anesthesia, preferably with a halogenated agent (eg,\\nhalothane) to provide \\nuterine relaxation.

Iron supplements should begin with resumption of oral intake.\\nB. Surgical Repositioning of the Uterus\\nSurgical repositioning of the uterus is rarely necessary in contemporary medical practice in the United\\nStates. However, when all other efforts have failed to reposition the everted uterus, operative\\nintervention may be lifesaving. This is generally accomplished by a vertical incision through the\\nlower uterine segment directly posterior. The uterus is repositioned by either pulling from above or,\\nvery rarely, pushing from below (using a sterile glove). The incision is then repaired as would be any\\nuterine incision.

The\\nprognosis for women with uterine inversion in whom the uterus was successfully restored to its\\nnormal anatomic position is generally considered to be excellent.\\nPOSTPARTUM & PUERPERAL INFECTIONS\\nGeneral Considerations\\nInfections are among the most prominent puerperal complications. An improved understanding of the\\nnatural history of female genital infections and the availability of powerful antibiotics may have\\nproduced a complacent attitude toward puerperal infections that is unrealistic. Postpartum infections\\nstill are costly to both patients and society, and they are associated with an admittedly small but not\\nnegligible threat of serious disability and death.\\nPuerperal morbidity due to infection has occurred if the patient’s temperature is higher than 38°C\\n(100.4°F) on 2 separate occasions at least 24 hours apart following the first 24 hours after delivery.\\nOvert infections can and do occur in the absence of these criteria, but fever of some degree remains\\nthe hallmark of puerperal infection, and the patient with fever can be assumed to have a genital\\ninfection until proved otherwise.\\nIncidence\\nPuerperal infectious morbidity affects 2–8% of pregnant women and is more common in those of low\\nsocioeconomic status, who have undergone operative delivery, with premature rupture of the\\nmembranes, with long labors, or who have multiple pelvic examinations.\\nMorbidity & Mortality\\nPostpartum infections are responsible for much of the morbidity associated with childbirth, and they\\neither are directly \\nresponsible for or contribute to the death of approximately 7% of all pregnant\\nwomen who die each year in the United States. The costs are considerable, not only in additional days\\nof hospitalization and medications but also in time lost from work.\\nSterility may result from the sequelae of postpartum infections, such as periadnexal adhesions.\\nHysterectomy occasionally is required in patients with serious postpartum or postoperative infection.'),\n",

In\\nwomen who have undergone caesarean section, more devitalized tissue and foreign bodies (sutures)\\nare present, providing additional fertile ground for possible contamination and subsequent infection.\\nApproximately 70% of puerperal soft tissue infections are mixed infections consisting of both aerobic\\nand anaerobic organisms; infections occurring in women undergoing caesarean section are more likely\\nto be serious.\\nGeneral Evaluation\\nThe source of infection should be identified, the likely cause determined, and the severity assessed.\\nMost women with fever in the postpartum period have endometritis.

Uterine tenderness\\n—The uterus is soft and exquisitely tender. Motion of the cervix and uterus may\\ncause increased pain.\\nAbdominal tenderness is generally limited to the lower abdomen and does not lateralize. A\\ncarefully performed baseline examination should include an adnexal evaluation. Adnexal masses\\npalpable on abdominal or pelvic examination are not seen in uncomplicated endometritis, but tubo-\\novarian abscess may be a later complication of an infection originally confined to the uterus.

Hematologic findings\\n—Leukocytosis is a normal finding during labor and the immediate puerperal\\nperiod.

Lower abdominal pain is common as the uterus undergoes involution\\nwith continuing contractions.\\nExtragenital infections are much less common than endometritis and urinary tract infections. Most\\nof these infections can be effectively ruled out by history and examination alone.

After delivery, the\\nbladder and lower urinary tract remain somewhat hypotonic, and residual urine and reflux result. This\\naltered physiologic state, in conjunction with catheterization, birth trauma, conduction anesthesia,\\nfrequent pelvic examinations, and nearly continuous contamination of the perineum, is sufficient to\\nexplain the high incidence of lower urinary tract infections postpartum.

High fluid intake should be encouraged.\\nPyelonephritis requires initial therapy with high doses of IV antibiotics, such as ampicillin 8–12\\ng/d or first-generation cephalosporins (cefazolin 3–6 g/d, cephalothin 4–8 g/d). An aminoglycoside\\ncan be added when resistant organisms are suspected or when the patient has clinical signs of sepsis. A\\nlong-acting third-generation cephalosporin, such as ceftriaxone 1–2 g every 12 hours, also can be\\nused. The response to therapy may be rapid, but some women respond with gradual defervescence\\nover 48 hours or longer. Urine cultures should be obtained to guide any necessary modifications in\\ndrug therapy if the patient’s response is not prompt. Even with prompt resolution of fever, antibiotic\\ntherapy should be continued IV or orally for a total of 10 days.

Caesarean Section Wound Infection\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n Wound erythema and tenderness +/− drainage from the wound\\n The patient may also demonstrate systemic signs of infection such as fever or malaise\\nPathogenesis\\nWound infection occurs in 4–12% of patients after caesarean section. The following risk factors\\npredispose to subsequent wound infection in women undergoing caesarean section: obesity, diabetes,\\nprolonged hospitalization before caesarean section, prolonged rupture of the membranes,\\nchorioamnionitis, endomyometritis, prolonged labor, emergency rather than elective indications for\\ncaesarean section, and anemia.\\nPrevention\\nThe high rate of infection (averaging 35–40%) after caesarean section is sufficient reason to consider\\nprophylactic perioperative antibiotic administration. A major difference in practice in terms of\\nprophylactic antibiotic administration prior to caesarean delivery has recently been advocated. While\\nhistorically antimicrobial prophylaxis has been given after umbilical cord clamping, due to concerns\\nregarding the masking of a neonatal infection, reductions in postcaesarean wound infection as great as\\n50% can be attributed to a single dose of cefazolin (1 g) given IV prior to skin incision.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms & Signs\\nFever with no apparent cause that persists to the fourth or fifth postoperative day strongly suggests a\\nwound infection. Wound erythema and tenderness may not be evident until several days after surgery.\\nOccasionally, wound infections are manifested by spontaneous drainage, often accompanied by\\nresolution of fever and relief of local tenderness.

Laboratory Findings\\nGram-stained smears and culture of material from the wound may be helpful in guiding selection of\\nthe initial antibiotic.

Initial Evaluation\\nThe incision should be opened along its entire length and the deeper portion of the wound gently\\nexplored to determine whether fascial separation has occurred.

The skin can be left open to undergo delayed closure or to heal by primary intention.\\nIf the fascia is intact, the wound infection can be treated by local measures.\\nB. Definitive Measures\\nMechanical cleansing of the wound is the mainstay of therapy for caesarean wound infection. Opening\\nthe wound encourages drainage of infected material. The wound can be packed with saline-soaked\\ngauze 2–3 times per day, which will remove necrotic debris each time the wound is unpacked. The\\nwound can be left open to heal, or it can be closed secondarily when granulation tissue has begun to\\nform.\\nCostantine MM, Rahman M, Ghulmiyah L, et al.

Subsequent contamination during the healing phase also should be\\ncommon, yet infection and disruption of the wound are infrequent (0.5–3%). The excellent local blood\\nsupply is suggested as an explanation for this phenomenon.\\nIn general, the more extensive the laceration or episiotomy, the greater are the chances for\\ninfection and breakdown of the wound. More tissue is devitalized in a large episiotomy, thereby\\nproviding greater opportunity for contamination. Women with infections elsewhere in the genital area\\nprobably are at greater risk for infection of the episiotomy.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms & Signs\\nPain at the episiotomy site is the most common symptom. Spontaneous drainage is frequent, so a mass\\nrarely forms. Incontinence of flatus and stool may be the presenting symptom of an episiotomy that\\nbreaks down and heals spontaneously.\\nInspection of the episiotomy site shows disruption of the wound and gaping of the incision. A\\nnecrotic membrane may cover the wound and should be debrided if possible. A careful rectovaginal\\nexamination should be performed to determine whether a rectovaginal fistula has formed. The\\nintegrity of the anal sphincter should be evaluated.\\nB. Laboratory Findings\\nInfection with mixed aerobic and anaerobic organisms is common. \\nStaphylococcus\\n may be recovered\\nfrom cultures of material from these infections. Culture results frequently are misleading because the\\narea of the episiotomy typically is contaminated with a wide variety of pathogenic bacteria.\\nTreatment\\nInitial treatment should be directed toward opening and cleaning the wound and promoting the\\nformation of granulation tissue. Warm sitz baths or Hubbard tank treatments help the debridement\\nprocess. Attempts to close an infected, disrupted episiotomy are likely to fail and may make ultimate\\nclosure more difficult. Surgical closure by perineorrhaphy should be undertaken only after granulation\\ntissue has thoroughly covered the wound site. There is an increasing trend toward early repair of\\nepisiotomy wound dehiscence, in contrast to conventional wisdom, which suggests a 3- to 4-month\\ndelay.

If she does not, tight\\nbreast binding, ice packs, restriction of breast stimulation, and analgesics help to relieve pain and\\nsuppress lactation. Medical suppression of lactation probably does not hasten involution of congested\\nbreasts unless the drug is taken very early after delivery. Bromocriptine 2.5 mg twice daily orally for\\n10 days is an effective regimen, although concerns about its side effect profile have curtailed its use.\\nFor the woman who is breastfeeding, manually emptying the breasts following infant feeding is all\\nthat is necessary to relieve discomfort.\\nB. Infectious Mastitis\\nInfectious mastitis is treated in the same way as congestive mastitis. Local heat and support of the\\nbreasts help to reduce pain. Cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, nafcillin, or a cephalosporin—antibiotic with\\nactivity against the commonly encountered causative organisms—should be administered. Infants\\ntolerate the small amount of antibiotics in breast milk without difficulty. It may be prudent to check\\nthe infant for possible colonization with the same bacteria present in the mother’s breast.\\nIf an abscess is present, incision and drainage are necessary. The cavity should be packed open with\\ngauze, which is then advanced toward the surface in stages daily. Most authorities recommend\\ncessation of breastfeeding when an abscess develops.

Numerous studies have shown improved outcomes for low-birth-weight (LBW)\\ninfants (<2500 g) who are delivered at a center with a higher level of neonatal care.\\nSuccessful transition from fetal to ex utero life involves a complex series of hormonal and\\nphysiologic changes, many of which occur or begin before birth.

If meconium is suctioned from the\\ntrachea, another attempt should be made to intubate the patient and suction the trachea again.\\nHowever, if the patient has significant bradycardia, it may be appropriate to defer repeated suctioning\\nand provide PPV.\\nThe majority (94–97%) of infants born through meconium-stained fluid will not develop\\nmeconium aspiration syndrome, but when it does occur, infants are often critically ill. Meconium can\\nblock the airway and prevent the newborn’s lungs from filling with air, a vital step in normal\\ntransitioning. Meconium aspiration into the lungs can cause obstruction of the small airways and\\nconsequently areas of atelectasis, gas trapping, and overdistention in addition to a chemical\\npneumonitis. The infant born through meconium may have pulmonary hypertension and inadequate\\noxygenation and requires close observation and early initiation of treatment when appropriate.\\nB. Asphyxia\\nDespite optimal prenatal care, some infants sustain injury prior to or during delivery that results in\\nasphyxia. Perinatal asphyxia is characterized by the presence of hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and\\nmetabolic acidemia. It is the result of compromised oxygen delivery and blood flow to the fetus,\\neither chronically or acutely, that stems from processes such as placental insufficiency, cord\\ncompression, trauma, and placental abruption.\\nIf significant prepartum or peripartum hypoxic–ischemic injury has occurred, the infant likely will\\nbe depressed at birth and may not respond to initial interventions to establish respiration. The initial\\nresponse in the newborn to hypoxemia is rapid breathing, followed shortly thereafter by a period of\\napnea, termed \\nprimary apnea\\n. Drying the infant and rubbing the back or flicking the soles of the feet\\nis sufficient to stimulate respiration during primary apnea. However, without intervention at this\\npoint, continued oxygen deprivation will lead to a series of gasps followed by a period of secondary\\napnea. It is important to recognize that an infant who does not respond to stimulation is likely\\nexhibiting secondary apnea and requires further intervention. Respiration will not resume with\\nstimulation if secondary apnea has begun, and positive pressure is necessary to reverse the process.\\nHeart rate changes typically begin toward the end of primary apnea, whereas blood pressure typically\\nis maintained until the period of secondary apnea.\\nEffective resuscitation of an asphyxiated newborn usually requires treatment of acidosis. Perinatal\\nasphyxia may also be complicated by hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia. Myocardial dysfunction may\\nbe present, and fluid boluses and continuous infusion of inotrope may be required for adequate blood\\npressure support. However, in the presence of significant myocardial dysfunction, repeated volume\\nboluses will worsen the cardiovascular status. In these cases, early administration of an inotrope (eg,\\ndobutamine) with or without low to moderate doses of a vasopressor (eg, dopamine) is appropriate. In\\naddition, seizures may occur in the newborn with perinatal asphyxia. Seizures usually are the result of\\nhypoxic–ischemic injury to the cerebral cortex, but hypoglycemia and hypocalcemia also may cause\\nseizure activity in the depressed neonate. In the newborn, phenobarbital (15–20 mg/kg IV) typically is\\ngiven as the first-line treatment of seizures not caused by hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia. An\\nadditional 5–10 mg/kg bolus can be given to control status epilepticus. Asphyxiated infants are at\\nincreased risk for persistent pulmonary hypertension (discussed in detail later in the section Pathology\\n& Care of the High-Risk Term Neonate).\\nThe severity of the insult sustained by the newborn can be difficult to assess in the neonatal period.\\nThe presence of abnormal findings on the neurologic examination and the severity and persistence of\\nthose abnormalities are the most useful measures for assessing the degree of brain injury.

Early onset of seizure\\nactivity has been shown to increase the likelihood of a poor outcome. Infants with severe hypoxic–\\nischemic \\nencephalopathy, which is characterized by absent reflexes, flaccid muscle tone, seizures, and\\na markedly altered level of consciousness, either die within several days of birth or have significant\\nneurologic sequelae.

A\\nminority of cases of cerebral palsy are actually attributable to intrapartum complications.\\nSeveral randomized, controlled studies have shown that induced hypothermia is protective in\\nbabies with mild-moderate asphyxia. Both selective hypothermia (ie, head cooling) and total body\\ncooling have been shown to be effective. Devices are now available to regulate and safely cool\\nneonates to a core temperature of 33.5–34.5°C. Therefore, it is now recommended that infants with\\nmoderate asphyxia should be cooled. Ideally the therapy should be initiated within 6 hours of the\\nevent (ie, birth). Timely transfer to a center that provides therapeutic hypothermia is of the utmost\\nimportance.\\nC. Shock\\nThe newborn who fails to respond to initial attempts at resuscitation may be in circulatory shock. A\\nnumber of different pathophysiologic processes can result in shock in the delivery room. Circulatory\\ncollapse can result from absolute (hemorrhage, capillary leak) or relative (vasodilatation)\\nhypovolemia, cardiac dysfunction (asphyxia, congenital heart disease [CHD]), abnormal peripheral\\nvasoregulation (prematurity, asphyxia, sepsis), or a combination of these factors. The peripartum\\nhistory often helps elucidate the etiology. The presence of risk factors for sepsis (prolonged rupture of\\nmembranes, maternal fever, chorioamnionitis), hemorrhage (placenta previa, placental abruption,\\ntrauma), or perinatal asphyxia may be informative. Pallor or peripheral hyperemia, weak pulses with\\ntachycardia, and cool or warm extremities are present on examination. Hypotension in the newborn\\nimmediately following delivery is commonly defined as a mean arterial pressure that is equal to or\\nless than the gestational age. It is worth noting that blood pressure is normal in the early\\n(compensated) phase of shock; hypotension may only develop as the process progresses.\\nAs mentioned earlier in Delivery Room Management, a 10 cc/kg normal saline bolus typically is\\ngiven to the newborn with hypotension. An additional 10–20 cc/kg is often given if the improvement\\nin circulation is inadequate. Unmatched O-negative blood can be transfused in 10–15 cc/kg aliquots if\\nsevere anemia from blood loss is suspected. Volume should be administered slowly and judiciously to\\npreterm infants who lack the mechanisms to autoregulate cerebral blood flow and protect the brain\\nagainst reperfusion injury. Excessive volume may worsen the patient’s status if cardiac dysfunction is\\nthe cause of hypotension. As discussed earlier, administration of sodium bicarbonate or THAM\\n(tromethamine) may be indicated to treat metabolic acidosis in the newborn in shock.\\nVasopressor/inotrope infusions should be initiated in neonates who do not respond to volume\\nresuscitation.\\nD. Cyanosis\\nAlthough acrocyanosis (cyanosis of the hands and feet) is often normal in the newborn, central\\ncyanosis is not. Cyanosis is due to inadequate oxygen delivery to the tissue, either as a result of poor\\nblood flow (peripheral vasoconstriction in acrocyanosis or low cardiac output in cardiogenic shock) or\\ninsufficiently oxygenated blood (pulmonary hypertension or severe parenchymal lung disease). Free-\\nflow oxygen can be administered if a newborn has central cyanosis despite regular respirations. Free-'),\n",

Oxygen can be gradually withdrawn when\\nthe newborn turns pink.

As discussed earlier, provision of 100% oxygen may have\\nsignificant side effects if it is used for newborn resuscitation.\\nE. Prematurity\\nThe delivery of a preterm infant requires a skilled multidisciplinary resuscitation team that has an\\nunderstanding of the myriad problems associated with preterm delivery and has experience handling\\nVLBW newborns. The presence at delivery of physicians, nurses, and a respiratory therapist trained in\\nnewborn resuscitation will optimize the early care of the newborn. Details of the delivery room care of\\nthe preterm infant are discussed in the section Delivery Room Management earlier in this chapter.\\nThe neonatal team should meet with the family prior to delivery whenever possible. The parents\\nshould be informed about the prognosis for the fetus and need for intensive care admission if\\nappropriate. It is critical that the family understand the plan for resuscitation in the delivery room and\\nthe anticipated short- and long-term problems the newborn may face. Often it is helpful to families to\\ndiscuss the emotional impact of the admission and the possibility of a prolonged stay of their newborn\\nin the intensive care unit. If the fetus is at the limits of viability, currently considered 23–24 weeks’\\ngestation and/or weight <500 g, it is essential that the parents understand the considerable risk of\\ndeath and the serious cognitive, motor, and pulmonary complications that may occur if the newborn\\ndoes survive. The neonatal team must have a clear conversation with the parents about the possible\\noptions for postnatal management. Unfortunately, it often is difficult to make definitive plans given\\nthat the margin of error for prenatal determination of birth weight and gestational age is wide enough\\nto have a significant impact on the viability of the fetus. Although many physicians have strong\\nfeelings of their own, it is vital that the course of resuscitation of a newborn at the limits of viability\\nincorporates the family’s wishes. Nevertheless, parents should understand that the fetus’s viability\\nwill be reassessed after delivery, \\nand that the maturity of the newborn, the newborn’s condition at\\ndelivery, and the response to the resuscitative efforts made, in combination with available outcomes\\ndata, ultimately will determine the management in the delivery room.\\nF. Abdominal Wall Defects\\nGastroschisis\\n is the herniation of abdominal contents through an abdominal wall defect. The defect in\\ngastroschisis usually is small and to the right of the umbilicus, and the intestines are unprotected by\\nthe peritoneal sac. \\nOmphalocele\\n also involves the herniation of abdominal contents through the\\nabdominal wall, but the defect is in the umbilical portion of the abdominal wall, and the herniated\\nviscera are covered by the peritoneal sac. Both defects require emergent care in the delivery room.\\nCurrent delivery room recommendations suggest positioning the baby right side down to avoid\\nkinking the mesenteric blood vessels and compromising blood flow to the intestines. The baby’s lower\\nbody, including the defect and externalized organs, should be placed in a “bowel bag,” which is then\\nsecured at the mid-thorax. This allows for direct visualization of the intestines while also limiting\\nfluid losses. A nasogastric tube (at least 10 French) should be placed to allow for adequate\\ndecompression of the stomach and intestines.\\nDespite these measures, patients will still have increased heat and insensible fluid losses, and IV\\nfluid should be started promptly at 1.5 times normal maintenance requirements to prevent dehydration\\nand hypernatremia.

However, prematurity continues to account for a significant percentage of\\nneonatal and infant mortality in the United States. As tinier and less mature infants survive, we face\\nnew ethical and medical challenges to continue improving the long-term and societal impact of the\\ncare provided in the NICU.\\nRespiratory Distress Syndrome\\nIn 1959, Mary Ellen Avery and Jere Mead reported data showing that the severe respiratory disease\\nseen in preterm infants, then known as hyaline membrane disease, was due in part to a deficiency of\\nsurfactant. Surfactant, a complex of phospholipids and protein secreted by type II pneumocytes,\\nreduces surface tension in the alveoli of the lung. Its absence, or deficiency, results in diffuse\\nmicroatelectasis and decreased functional residual capacity leading to the presentation of a “ground-\\nglass” pattern and poor expansion of the lungs on chest radiograph (CXR). The lung disease of the\\npreterm infant, now known as respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), also is a consequence of the\\nimmature architecture of the lung at the time of birth.\\nRDS presents as tachypnea and increased work of breathing that develops shortly after birth. Both\\noxygenation and ventilation are impaired, and blood gas analysis typically reveals hypoxia and a\\nrespiratory acidosis. Although most commonly seen in premature infants, RDS is associated with\\nother conditions as well. Infants of diabetic mothers are at risk, even at term, because high levels of\\ninsulin in the fetus suppress lung maturation, including surfactant production. Without intervention,\\nRDS typically worsens over the first few days of postnatal life. Historically, improvement was often\\nheralded by a marked increase in urine output (“diuretic phase” of RDS).\\nThe likelihood of RDS is inversely proportional to gestational age. It now is standard to give\\ncorticosteroids to mothers at risk of delivery before 32–34 weeks’ gestation to hasten maturation of\\nfetal organs, including the lungs, and to decrease the incidence and severity of RDS. Some larger\\npreterm infants may require supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or no respiratory assistance'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='whatsoever. Babies with significant RDS typically require assisted ventilation. Ventilatory support\\ncan be given with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), a pressure- or volume-limited\\nventilator, or a high-frequency ventilator. A recent analysis concluded the data are not sufficient to\\nrecommend any mode of mechanical ventilation over the other as standard therapy for RDS. Provision\\nof positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (either as CPAP or PEEP) quickly after delivery is vital in\\norder to prevent collapse of the lungs. If the lungs are allowed to collapse, oxygenation and ventilation\\nwill be compromised further and higher pressures will be required to reinflate the lungs, causing\\navoidable barotrauma and volutrauma to the lungs.\\nExogenous surfactant administration has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality from RDS\\nsince its routine use began in the early 1990s. Prophylactic administration of surfactant to the preterm\\ninfant (ie, before 15 minutes of age) has been shown to reduce neonatal morbidity (pneumothorax \\nand\\npulmonary interstitial edema) and mortality compared to rescue therapy (ie, waiting until after the\\ndiagnosis of RDS is made). Proposed explanations of this finding include a more homogeneous\\ndistribution of surfactant in the fluid-filled lung and the delivery of surfactant after a minimal period\\nof PPV minimizing barotrauma and volutrauma to the lung. However, it is very important to ensure\\ncorrect placement of the ETT prior to surfactant administration in the delivery room. If the ETT\\nposition cannot be determined, it may be better to delay surfactant until CXR has confirmed\\nplacement. If the degree of RDS is significant, an additional 2–4 doses of surfactant can be given\\nevery 6–12 hours depending on the surfactant preparation used. The newborn should be monitored\\nclosely after receiving surfactant because rapid changes in respiratory status usually occur,\\nnecessitating aggressive weaning of the ventilator settings. If the ventilator support is not weaned\\nappropriately, the improving lung compliance will result in high tidal volume ventilation leading to\\nvolu-trauma and hypocapnia. Complications such as obstruction of the ETT, pneumothorax, or\\npulmonary hemorrhagic edema may occur with surfactant. Pulmonary hemorrhagic edema likely is\\ndue to the surfactant administration-associated rapid decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance and\\nthe resulting pulmonary overcirculation through the ductus arteriosus. Blood gases should be checked\\nfrequently to prevent hypocapnia, which is associated with an increased incidence of periventricular\\nleukomalacia (PVL) in the preterm neonate.\\nDespite the advances attributable to prenatal steroids, surfactant, and newer modes of ventilation,\\nRDS continues to carry significant morbidity, including the risk of chronic lung disease, which is\\ndefined as the need for supplemental oxygen or ventilatory support at 36 weeks’ postmenstrual age.\\nNew strategies have evolved over recent years to improve outcomes of newborns with RDS. Given the\\ntoxicities of oxygen, as discussed earlier, efforts are being made to limit exposure of preterm infants\\nto hyper-oxia. Many centers now aim to keep the oxygen saturation percent in the 80s or low 90s for\\npreterm babies to prevent periods of hyperoxygenation and free-radical production. Although the data\\nare scant and not well controlled, no current evidence suggests adverse neurologic effects of the lower\\nsaturations. However, it is recommended that saturations be kept in the high 90s once an infant’s\\ncorrected gestational age reaches near-term. Future studies must be designed to investigate the\\npotential side effects of lower saturations, including the development of pulmonary hypertension and\\nsubsequent cor pulmonale during infancy or early childhood.\\nAnother recent change in neonatal practice has been the adoption of permissive hypercapnia.\\nPermissive hypercapnia involves allowing CO\\n2\\n levels in the blood to rise above the normal value of\\n40 mm Hg in order to minimize the pressures required for ventilation and thereby reduce the lung\\ninjury caused by ventilator-induced barotrauma and volu-trauma. This practice allows for infants to\\nremain extubated who might have been reintubated in the past because of CO\\n2\\n retention. Although the\\nprocedure differs, CO\\n2\\n levels of 45–55 mm Hg are generally accepted, with some centers allowing'),\n",

The side effects of this approach are\\nunknown, but hypercapnia may decrease the autoregulatory capacity of cerebral vessels, resulting in a\\nmore or less pressure-passive cerebral circulation. Therefore, the potential long-term\\nneurodevelopmental effects of hypercapnia-associated pressure-passive cerebral circulation require\\ninvestigation.\\nEncouraged by data from nonrandomized studies at Columbia University, many neonatologists are\\nnow trying to avoid intubation and/or mechanical ventilation, even in the tiniest babies. Using CPAP\\nwith nasal prongs for newborns with respiratory distress soon after birth (regardless of gestational age\\nor birth weight) and a strategy of permissive hypercapnia, physicians at Columbia University reported\\na low incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) compared to other tertiary care centers,\\nwithout any significant increase in mortality. Because these findings require confirmation in\\nappropriately designed randomized clinical trials, some centers have chosen an intermediate\\napproach: VLBW infants are intubated for surfactant administration, but the ETT is removed shortly\\nafter and the period of mechanical ventilation is brief. Although approaches differ, early extubation is\\nnow a widely shared goal among neonatologists.\\nDexamethasone was a key part of efforts to prevent and/or treat BPD for many years. However, a\\nnumber of studies have shown a worse neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants who received\\ndexamethasone treatment compared to controls with a similar degree of illness in the neonatal period.\\nMany studies are still in progress, and data on long-term outcomes are not yet available, but the\\nroutine use of dexamethasone is no longer recommended. Dexamethasone is now reserved for those\\npatients with the most severe lung disease, although, in general, no data support a better pulmonary\\noutcome with its use. The available data suggest that there may be a window for dexamethasone use at\\n7–14 postnatal days, categorized as “moderately early” treatment, which has not been seen to cause\\nany adverse outcomes. However, as mentioned earlier, a significant direct benefit associated with the\\nuse of dexamethasone is not available. Steroids also are now usually given in lower doses and shorter\\ncourses than in the past. The AAP currently recommends that neonatologists counsel parents about the\\nrisks and benefits of dexamethasone prior to initiating treatment. Future studies are needed to evaluate\\nthe effect, if any, of the newer treatment regimens on neurodevelopment outcome.\\nNutrition\\nProviding optimal nutrition is an essential and challenging part of the care of the premature baby.\\nPreterm infants are born with minimal nutrient stores and high metabolic demands, and growth failure\\nis a frequent complication of prematurity. Supplying adequate nutrition for growth and \\ndevelopment is\\ncomplicated by the fact that many preterm newborns are too unstable to receive enteral nutrition in the\\nfirst few days of postnatal life. There may be clear contraindications to enteral feeding, such as\\nhypotension and vasopressor requirements, or factors can arise that can raise concerns about early\\ninitiation of enteral feeds, such as cocaine exposure in utero, indomethacin administration, the\\npresence of a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), or respiratory instability. Parenteral hyperalimentation\\nis used to meet the newborn’s initial fluid and nutritional requirements, but the ultimate goal is to\\nmeet those needs with enteral feedings given as early as safely possible.\\nAn IV infusion of 10% glucose typically is started soon after birth to maintain glucose\\nhomeostasis. Extremely low-birth-weight (ELBW) babies (birth weight <1000 g) may require lower\\nconcentrations of dextrose because of higher total fluid requirements. Calcium supplementation in the\\ndextrose infusion is standard for VLBW babies because transfer of calcium from mother to fetus\\nprimarily occurs during the third trimester, so VLBW babies are born with inadequate stores.

As a result, protein supplementation should be started as soon\\nas possible to prevent a catabolic state. Parenteral hyperalimentation containing amino acids can be\\nsafely initiated immediately after delivery without development of acidosis, hyperammonemia, or\\nuremia. The amino acid infusion should be started at 1.5–2.5 g/kg/d and advanced over several days to\\na goal of 3–4 g/kg/d.\\nPreterm newborns typically require a glucose infusion rate (GIR) of 6–8 mg/kg/min. The GIR is\\nadvanced in small increments to provide additional calories. Carbohydrate should account for\\napproximately 40% of the 90–120 kcal/kg/d provided to the neonatal patient receiving parenteral\\nnutrition. (Caloric requirements are higher with enteral feeding, typically 120–150 kcal/kg/d.) The\\nneed for GIR in excess of 15–18 mg/kg/min for adequate caloric support is rare. Glucose levels should\\nbe monitored and the dextrose infusion adjusted to maintain normoglycemia (ie, plasma glucose\\nconcentration 60–160 mg/dL). An insulin infusion can be started in the unusual event that\\nhyperglycemia persists despite restricting the GIR to 4–6 mg/kg/min to continue to provide adequate\\ncalories for growth.\\nIntralipids provide the essential fatty acids required for multiple physiologic processes.

Usually a continuous 20% infusion at 0.5–1 g/kg/d is started on the first or second day of\\nlife, with the ultimate goal of providing 3 g/kg/d. Triglyceride and cholesterol levels must be\\nmonitored closely; elevated levels may require lower levels of lipid supplementation. Lipid infusion\\nof 0.5–1 g/kg/d is required to prevent essential fatty acid deficiency.\\nIn addition to providing protein, glucose, and fats, parenteral hyperalimentation provides\\nelectrolytes, vitamins, and minerals for the preterm infant unable to tolerate enteral feeds.

Signs and symptoms often are specific to the\\ngastrointestinal tract, such as abdominal distention and/or erythema, emesis, bilious gastric residuals,\\nand bloody stools; however, they may be nonspecific, such as apnea, temperature instability, and\\nlethargy. Findings may be subtle initially, or the onset may be fulminant. Acidosis and\\nthrombocytopenia are worrisome findings that may indicate necrotic bowel. Hyponatremia, due to\\nupregulated sodium transport into the gut, and edema, due to increased capillary leak, often develop.\\nRespiratory distress develops from abdominal competition due to inflammation and distention. The\\npathognomonic feature of NEC is the presence of intestinal pneumatosis on abdominal x-ray.\\nPneumatosis results from the production of hydrogen from bacteria in the bowel wall. Serial x-rays\\nare obtained to follow disease progression. Air in the portal venous system or free air in the abdominal\\ncavity indicates intestinal perforation, warranting surgical intervention for either an exploratory\\nlaparotomy to resect the necrotic bowel or placement of a right lower quadrant drain to decompress\\nthe abdomen if the patient is very small or unstable.

Many infants require fluid resuscitation and vasopressor/inotrope support. Seventy-five\\npercent of infants with NEC survive, but half sustain long-term complications such as intestinal\\nstrictures and short gut syndrome.\\nPrematurity and enteral feeds have been clearly linked to NEC, but the pathogenesis of NEC is not\\nwell defined and is widely considered to be multifactorial.

Other studies have\\nshown a decreased incidence and severity of NEC in VLBW neonates who received supplementation\\nwith probiotic bacteria such as \\nLactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium\\n spp., and \\nStreptococcus\\nthermophilus\\n. However, further studies are needed to examine the safety of probiotics given recent\\nreports of sepsis due to supplemented probiotic organisms. Antenatal steroids also have a protective\\neffect against NEC, likely due to a demonstrated effect on gastrointestinal maturation and PDA\\nclosure.\\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus\\nDuring fetal life, close to 90% of the blood that leaves the right ventricle flows from the pulmonary\\nartery to the aorta through the ductus arteriosus. After birth the pulmonary pressure falls, blood flow\\nto the lungs increases, and the ductus arteriosus, primarily as a response to the increased oxygen\\ntension in the blood and decreased circulating levels of prostaglandin E\\n2\\n (PGE\\n2\\n), begins to close.\\nFunctional closure of the ductus arteriosus occurs within the first 1–2 days of postnatal life in the vast\\nmajority of term neonates, and definitive anatomic closure of the ductus usually is complete by the\\nend of the first postnatal week. However, in neonates born prematurely, this process takes longer and\\nmay not always occur. In preterm neonates, failure of the ductus arteriosus to close is the result of\\nseveral factors, including persistent hypoxia as a result of RDS and the continued presence of PGE\\n2\\n. A\\nPDA may be asymptomatic initially, but as the pulmonary pressure continues to fall, the left-to-right\\nshunt of blood through the ductus arteriosus increases. Increasing left-to-right shunt produces\\npulmonary overcirculation (often with >50% of the left ventricular output shunting back into the\\nlungs), worsening respiratory distress and gas exchange, an increasing oxygen requirement, and\\nsystemic hypotension. The presence of a PDA is suggested on physical examination by a\\nhyperdynamic precordium (left ventricular overload), bounding palmar and brachial pulses, and a\\nholosystolic precordial murmur. The pulse pressure usually is wide, and CXR typically demonstrates\\ncardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion. Unless contraindications such as renal insufficiency, active\\nbleeding, or thrombocytopenia are present, indomethacin, a nonselective inhibitor of the\\ncyclooxygenase enzyme, is the first-line treatment of PDA because indomethacin effectively\\ndecreases prostaglandin synthesis. Indomethacin also has certain actions not directly related to\\ninhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, such as a drug-induced decrease in global cerebral blood flow.\\nThis action may contribute to the indomethacin-induced decrease in severe IVH observed in ELBW\\nneonates given indomethacin shortly after birth. However, there appears to be no significant long-term\\nneurodevelopmental benefit of prophylactic indomethacin administration. In neonates with a PDA,\\nfluids should be restricted to prevent worsening of pulmonary edema. Indomethacin may fail to\\nachieve closure of the ductus, particularly in those who were born most prematurely or who received\\ntherapy later in postnatal life (beyond 10–14 days).

It should also be noted that the combination of indomethacin and postnatal\\nsteroid use has been shown to increase the likelihood of a spontaneous intestinal perforation.\\nTherefore, care should be used when considering the use of those 2 drugs in combination.\\nIntraventricular Hemorrhage\\nIVH is one of the most feared complications of prematurity; severe IVH is a major risk for adverse\\nlong-term neurodevelopmental outcome. The incidence of IVH (approximately 20% in VLBW\\ninfants) is inversely proportional to gestational age. A number of factors combine to put the preterm\\nneonate at risk. The blood vessels in the periventricular germinal matrix are abundant, immature, and\\nfragile. These vessels may bleed when exposed to changes in blood flow. Sick newborns often\\nexperience periods of hypotension and hypertension, and they lack effective autoregulatory\\nmechanisms to protect the brain during these variations in perfusion pressure. Changes in carbon\\ndioxide levels in the blood also play an important role in regulating cerebral blood flow, and VLBW\\nnewborns may swing from hypocarbia to hypercarbia and back, particularly during the first few hours\\nof life. In addition, bleeding may be aggravated by abnormal coagulation, particularly in the septic\\nnewborn.\\nMost IVH occurs during the first postnatal day; few cases occur after 5 days of life. Recent findings\\nsuggest that, at least in the VLBW neonate, IVH during the transitional period is caused by an\\nischemia–reperfusion cycle. Although IVH usually occurs without any clear outward signs that the\\nprocess is occurring, a large bleed may cause a sudden change in mental status, a drop in hematocrit\\n(Hct) level, and/or a full fontanelle. IVH is characterized as grade I when hemorrhage is confined to\\nthe region of the germinal matrix.

It is the second most common cause of blindness in children in the United States.\\nUnder normal conditions, the retina is completely vascularized by 36–40 weeks of gestation. The\\nearlier in gestation delivery occurs, the larger the avascular region of the retina at birth and the greater\\nthe risk for ROP. The pathogenesis of ROP is not completely clear but seems to involve a period of\\nvessel damage (from acidosis, hyperoxia, infection, etc) and cessation of vessel development followed\\nby a period of abnormal proliferation. Hyperoxia and/or fluctuations in PaO\\n2\\n have been clearly shown\\nto have an adverse effect on retinal development.\\nVLBW neonates, especially those who are critically ill and were born before 28 weeks’ completed\\ngestation, are at the highest risk for ROP. ROP tends to develop at 33 to 36 weeks’ corrected gestation\\nirrespective of the gestational age at birth. It may resolve spontaneously, as occurs in over 80–90% of\\ncases, or, in rare cases, may progress to complete retinal detachment. Screening ophthalmologic\\nexaminations are recommended to monitor the progression of retinal vascularization in infants born at\\nless than 31 weeks’ gestation or weighing less than 1500 g. Screening should also be considered for\\ninfants weighing 1500–2000 g or born at 31 weeks’ gestation or greater who have had an unstable\\ncourse. The initial examination should be performed at 4 weeks of life or 30–31 weeks’ corrected\\ngestational age, whichever comes later. The frequency of repeat examinations is dictated by the\\nfindings, with the goal being early detection of ROP that meets criteria for surgical intervention.\\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, Section on Ophthalmology.

Pulmonary vascular\\nresistance is elevated in utero; consequently minimal blood flow goes to the lungs. Instead, as noted in\\nPDA, close to 90% of the output from the right ventricle passes from the pulmonary artery to the aorta\\nthrough the ductus arteriosus. However, successful transition from fetal to extrauterine life requires a\\ndrop in pulmonary vascular resistance. The fall in pulmonary pressures results from a series of events\\nthat begins before birth but accelerates when a baby is born, the baby cries (filling the lungs with air),\\nand the umbilical cord is cut (increasing the systemic resistance). A number of processes can interrupt\\nthis process, either by mechanically blocking the airways, thus preventing essential lung expansion\\nand increase in the partial pressure of oxygen, or by preventing relaxation of the pulmonary vascular\\nbed. Meconium aspiration syndrome, asphyxia, sepsis, pneumonia, and CDH are among the most\\ncommon causes of persistently elevated pulmonary vascular resistance, termed \\npersistent pulmonary\\nhypertension of the newborn\\n (PPHN).\\nPPHN results in severe hypoxia in the newborn. Blood continues to shunt away from the pulmonary\\ncirculation through the foramen ovale, ductus arteriosus, or both, bringing poorly saturated blood to\\nthe body. Treatment consists of interventions aimed at lowering the pulmonary vascular resistance.\\nAcidosis and hypoxemia are potent pulmonary vasoconstrictors and are to be avoided. When possible,\\nPaO\\n2\\n is maintained in the normal range (80–100 mm Hg). Supplemental oxygen is weaned cautiously\\nbecause even relatively small changes can cause an acute decompensation. Every effort should be\\nmade to maintain left ventricular output and blood pressure (thus systemic perfusion) in the normal\\nrange and to keep the blood pH in the 7.3–7.4 range. Acidosis is a vasoconstrictor, but aggressive use\\nof bicarbonate or THAM may not be beneficial. Although hyperventilation was used in the past to\\nmaintain an alkaline pH, concerns about ventilator-induced lung damage and the effect of hypocarbia\\non cerebral blood flow have altered this practice. In addition, studies have shown that it is the\\nnormalized pH, not the decreased CO\\n2\\n, that improves pulmonary vasoconstriction. Most physicians\\nadjust the ventilator support to target a PaCO\\n2\\n of 40–50. High-frequency ventilators are often used,\\nallowing for higher mean airway pressures without increasing barotrauma and volutrauma to the\\nlungs. Vasopressors, typically dopamine, are used to maintain systemic blood pressure. If there is\\nevidence of myocardial dysfunction, an inotrope such as dobutamine typically is used, and\\nvasopressor support is adjusted to prevent undesirable increases in systemic vascular resistance.\\nPatients with PPHN are extremely sensitive to noise and tactile stimulation, so infusions of sedatives\\nand analgesia are routinely used to minimize agitation. However, use of neuromuscular blockade is to\\nbe avoided because it does not appear to improve clinical outcome and is associated with significant\\nside effects, including sensorineural hearing loss.\\nNitric oxide is a selective pulmonary vasodilator. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) has been proven to\\nimprove oxygenation and decrease the need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in\\nterm infants with PPHN. iNO is routinely \\nstarted at 20 ppm, although lower doses may be as effective.\\niNO is weaned as the patient stabilizes and the supplemental oxygen requirement falls. Despite the\\ndramatic improvement in outcomes since the availability of iNO, a number of patients with PPHN will'),\n",

Historically the criterion for ECMO has been a greater than 80% estimated risk of\\nmortality with continued conventional medical management. General guidelines for the criteria for\\nECMO include an oxygenation index greater than 35–60 for between 0.5 and 6 hours, an alveolar–\\narterial oxygen difference greater than 605–620 (at sea level) for 4–12 hours, or a preductal PaO\\n2\\n less\\nthan 40 for more than 2 hours. ECMO is contraindicated in neonates less than 34 weeks’ gestational\\nage because of technical issues regarding catheter placement as well as the increased risk of\\nintracranial bleeding in the preterm neonate. A preexisting grade II or higher IVH, signs of severe\\nirreversible brain damage, lethal congenital anomalies, and nonreversible pulmonary disease are other\\ncontraindications to ECMO. Survival of patients with PPHN treated with ECMO varies depending on\\nthe underlying cause of PPHN. The survival rate of patients with meconium aspiration syndrome is\\ngreater than 90%, but the survival rate of patients with CDH is only 50%.\\nCongenital Diaphragmatic Hernia\\nCDH is a defect that results from incomplete development and closure of the diaphragm, usually at the\\nforamen of Bochdalek at 8–10 weeks’ gestation. The defect in the diaphragm allows the contents of\\nthe abdominal cavity to migrate into the chest, resulting in compression of the lungs and, in more\\nsevere cases, the heart. The compression leads to pulmonary hypoplasia, abnormal lung development,\\nand potentially underdevelopment of 1 or both ventricles. Ninety percent of CDH involves the left\\nhemidiaphragm. CDH is now generally prenatally diagnosed, but a number of cases still go\\nundiagnosed, even with routine prenatal care.\\nA number of features should raise suspicion about the possibility of CDH in the newborn with\\ncyanosis and respiratory distress. Breath sounds may be absent on the left side of the chest and the\\nheart sounds shifted to the right. The abdomen tends to be scaphoid, as some of the abdominal organs\\ntypically have shifted into the thorax. It may be difficult to effectively ventilate and resuscitate the\\npatient. If a CDH is suspected, mask and bag ventilation must be avoided. The patient should be\\nintubated and a sump/replogle tube placed as soon as possible to prevent air from filling the stomach\\nand bowel and thus compromising ventilation further. Many centers use sedation and sometimes\\nparalysis to minimize activity and prevent competition from swallowed air. CXR observation of bowel\\nloops in the chest confirms the diagnosis.\\nSurgical repair of the defect usually is delayed until the patient’s condition stabilizes and the\\nreactive component of the pulmonary hypertension has improved. Efforts are made to use the lowest\\nventilator settings tolerated to minimize ventilator-induced lung injury. Surfactant, iNO, high-\\nfrequency ventilation, and, if necessary, ECMO are often used to manage patients with CDH.\\nHowever, surfactant administration has been shown to be of no benefit, and some studies suggest that\\nit may be associated with an increased need for ECMO, so its routine use cannot be recommended. To\\ndate, the evidence also has not shown a clear benefit of iNO for patients with CDH. Additional studies\\nare needed to evaluate the role of each of these interventions in the care of the patient with CDH.\\nReported survival rates vary from approximately 35–80%, perhaps reflecting differences between\\ncenters and/or bias related to referral patterns. The prognosis depends on the severity of the\\nunderlying pulmonary hypoplasia and the degree of reactive pulmonary hypertension, as well as the\\npresence of other anomalies or a chromosomal abnormality. Development of a pneumothorax has been\\nshown to predict a poor outcome. Failure to achieve a preductal PaO\\n2\\n greater than 100 mm Hg or a\\nPaCO\\n2\\n lower than 60 in the first 24 hours of life generally indicates a poor prognosis as well.

One of the most common causes of tachypnea in the newborn is transient\\ntachypnea of the newborn (TTN). TTN results when fetal lung fluid production fails to cease with the\\nonset of labor. The incidence of TTN is significantly increased when the baby is delivered via\\ncaesarean section without labor especially if performed before 39 weeks of gestation.\\nThe newborn presents with tachypnea, increased work of breathing, and cyanosis. Infants with TTN\\nmay require moderate supplemental oxygen; some may be sick enough to require intubation. CXR\\nreveals interstitial and alveolar edema; fluid is characteristically seen in the right middle lobe fissure.\\nSymptoms of TTN typically resolve over the first 24–48 hours (fetal lung fluid production ceases in\\nresponse to stress), and CXR clears by the second or third day of life. However, TTN is a diagnosis of\\nexclusion, and other causes of tachypnea and respiratory distress must be ruled out. An evaluation for\\nsepsis (including initiation of antibiotic therapy pending culture results) as well as other causes of\\ntachypnea is generally warranted.\\nCongenital Heart Disease\\nCHD occurs in approximately 1 in 100 live births, and approximately 3 in 1000 have CHD that\\nrequires surgical \\nrepair or results in death within the first year of life. CHD rarely presents in the\\ndelivery room. In fact, the majority of infants with prenatally diagnosed CHD initially appear well.\\nNevertheless, the newborn with cyanosis who fails to respond to 100% oxygen (hyperoxia test; see\\nbelow) should be evaluated for structural heart disease. Complex CHD typically presents as cyanosis\\nor congestive heart failure and circulatory shock and only rarely as an asymptomatic murmur in a\\nnewborn. Signs such as tachypnea, weak peripheral pulses, or cool extremities may develop quickly\\nwith closure of the ductus arteriosus if the lesion has ductal-dependent pulmonary or systemic flow.\\nRight-sided obstructive lesions (eg, pulmonic atresia or stenosis), which are dependent on the ductus\\nfor pulmonary blood flow, tend to present with cyanosis due to diminished or absent pulmonary blood\\nflow. Left-sided obstructive lesions (eg, coarctation of the aorta and hypoplastic left heart syndrome)\\ntypically present as shock and often are initially misdiagnosed as sepsis. However, statistically the\\nterm neonate who develops signs of shock after the first 24–48 hours of life is approximately 5 times\\nmore likely to have ductal-dependent CHD than bacterial sepsis.\\nThe initial steps in evaluating a stable patient for suspected CHD include 4-extremity blood\\npressure measurements, measurement of preductal and postductal saturations, electrocardiogram,\\nCXR, and hyperoxia test. If the PaO\\n2\\n level fails to increase above 100 after exposure to 100% fraction\\nof inspired oxygen (FiO\\n2\\n) for 15 minutes, cyanotic CHD is likely; if the PaO\\n2\\n level increases above\\n250, CHD is unlikely. CXR may reveal black lungs that signify diminished pulmonary blood flow (as\\noccurs in right-sided obstructive lesions) or congestion (as occurs with obstructed pulmonary venous\\nreturn). The diagnosis of CHD usually is established by echocardiogram, although cardiac\\ncatheterization is sometimes necessary to clarify the specifics of the abnormal anatomy in complex\\ncases. Low-dose PGE infusion should be started when critical CHD is suspected in order to maintain\\nor reestablish ductal patency. Once the diagnosis of cyanotic heart disease has been made,\\nsupplemental oxygen should be used sparingly but as necessary to keep oxygen saturations around 75–'),\n",

In its most common form, there is a proximal\\nesophageal pouch and a fistula between the trachea and the distal segment of the esophagus. The\\nnewborn with esophageal atresia typically presents in the first few hours after birth with copious\\nsecretions and coughing or gagging with the first feed. Respiratory distress may develop if secretions\\nor feeds are aspirated. The prenatal istory often is remarkable for polyhydramnios due to the inability\\nof the fetus to regulate amniotic fluid levels by swallowing. The diagnosis usually is apparent when a\\nCXR reveals a nasogastric tube coiled in the proximal esophageal pouch. Absence of a gastric bubble\\non x-ray usually suggests that a distal fistula is not present. Emergent gastrostomy may be necessary\\nto decompress the stomach. The feasibility of primary repair depends on the distance between the\\nproximal and distal portions of the esophagus. If primary repair is not possible, initial surgery\\ninvolves ligation of the fistula. Patients typically then undergo serial dilations of the proximal pouch\\nand delayed anastomosis or may require colonic interposition if the gap remains too wide to close.\\nPostoperative complications include leaking or stenosis at the anastomosis site, poor esophageal\\nmotility, and gastroesophageal reflux.\\nPolycythemia\\nPolycythemia, defined as a central venous Hct greater than 65%, results from either increased in utero\\nerythropoiesis or from maternofetal or twin–twin transfusion. Increased in utero erythropoiesis occurs\\nmost often as a response to fetal hypoxia, usually from placental insufficiency. Erythropoiesis in the\\nfetus is also increased with maternal diabetes, chromosomal abnormalities, and endocrine disorders\\nsuch as congenital adrenal hyperplasia, thyroid disease, and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.\\nMaternofetal hemorrhage most commonly results from delayed cord clamping.\\nPolycythemia may cause congestive heart failure from volume overload, as in the case of the\\nrecipient twin in twin–twin transfusion syndrome. More commonly, the complications attributed to\\npolycythemia arise from hyper-viscosity rather than increased blood volume. Blood viscosity\\nincreases as the Hct level rises, placing the polycythemic infant at risk for complications from\\nimpaired blood flow and oxygen delivery. Polycythemia may present as hypoglycemia, poor feeding,\\nrespiratory distress, pulmonary hypertension, lethargy, jitteriness, or seizures. Infants are at increased\\nrisk for NEC, and thrombotic strokes may occur.\\nAlthough IV hydration may be useful, a symptomatic neonate with Hct level greater than 65% or an\\nasymptomatic neonate with Hct level greater than 70% should undergo a partial exchange transfusion\\nperformed to decrease blood viscosity and ameliorate any symptoms. The volume of blood that should\\nbe removed and then replaced with isotonic saline (to lower the viscosity without causing\\nhypovolemia) is determined by the following formula:\\nVolume to be exchanged = [Blood volume × (Observed hematocrit – Desired hematocrit)]/Observed\\nhematocrit\\nBlood volume usually is estimated at 80–90 mL/kg in a term infant and 90–100 mL/kg in a preterm\\ninfant.

In most instances, the level of the unconjugated form of bilirubin\\nis elevated. Although the course usually is benign and an increase in serum bilirubin level occurs in all\\nnewborns during the first postnatal days, severe unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can cause\\nkernicterus and long-term neurologic damage.\\nBilirubin is produced when heme-containing compounds such as hemoglobin are broken down. The\\ninitial unconjugated product is fat soluble but water insoluble, a form that can cross the blood–brain\\nbarrier and cause central nervous system toxicity but cannot be excreted. The blood carries bilirubin to\\nthe liver, where it is conjugated to a water-soluble and excretable form by the enzyme glucuronyl\\ntransferase. The immature hepatic enzyme function in the newborn impairs bilirubin conjugation and\\nthus excretion. The shorter life span of red blood cells and increased red cell mass in neonates further\\npredispose the newborn to elevated plasma concentrations of bilirubin, as does the increased\\nreabsorption of bilirubin that occurs in the sterile newborn intestinal tract.\\nHyperbilirubinemia may be severe when other coexisting factors increase hemolysis, decrease the\\nrate of bilirubin conjugation, or impede excretion. Hemolysis is increased by abnormal red cell\\nenzyme function (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PD] deficiency, less frequently pyruvate\\nkinase deficiency) or morphology (spherocytosis, elliptocytosis) and isoimmunization due to ABO,\\nminor antigen, or Rh incompatibility. Sepsis can increase hemolysis. A number of inborn errors of\\nmetabolism and enzyme defects can impair conjugation. Conjugation is impaired when there is\\ndelayed maturation of the conjugating enzymes, as is thought to occur in cases of congenital\\nhypothyroidism. Obstructed biliary flow, as in biliary atresia, and gastrointestinal obstruction cause\\ndecreased excretion. Many disease states are associated with hyperbilirubinemia.\\nHyperbilirubinemia presents clinically as jaundice, a yellow–green discoloration of the skin and\\nmucous membranes. A serum bilirubin level should be checked in all jaundiced newborns. It is\\nstandard policy in some nurseries to check a total serum bilirubin (TSB) level in all newborns prior to\\ndischarge. Most centers check a level within 24–48 hours of life in all VLBW infants as risk for\\nsequelae from hyperbilirubinemia is believed to exist at lower serum bili-rubin concentrations in\\npreterm neonates. The etiology of the pathologic hyperbilirubinemia must be sought. A blood type,\\nCoombs’ test, Hct level, and reticulocyte count will provide important information, as will the\\nparent’s ethnicity, maternal blood type, and history of jaundice in siblings. It is important to\\ndetermine whether it is the level of conjugated or unconjugated fraction of bilirubin that is elevated.\\nThe differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment are markedly different depending on whether or\\nnot the elevated portion is conjugated. A conjugated bilirubin level greater than 10% of the total value\\nshould prompt an investigation for biliary obstruction or causes of hepatocellular damage such as\\nTORCH (toxoplasmosis, other agents, rubella, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex) infection,\\ngalactosemia, and α\\n1\\n-antitrypsin deficiency.

Risk factors for neonatal\\nsepsis include premature delivery, multiple pregnancy, prolonged rupture of amniotic membranes\\n(>18 hours), maternal fever, maternal group B \\nStreptococcus\\n (GBS) colonization, and\\nchorioamnionitis. The most common causes of early-onset (within the first week of life) sepsis are\\nGBS and \\nEscherichia coli.

In\\ncontrast, some neonates present in fulminant shock. A complete blood count and blood culture should\\nbe sent if sepsis is suspected and antibiotics should be started. A decreased or elevated white blood\\ncell count, a predominance of immature white blood cell forms, and thrombocytopenia are suggestive\\nof infection. Although nonspecific, an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level indicates the presence\\nof an inflammatory or infectious process, and data support the negative predictive value of a CRP\\nlevel in the evaluation for sepsis in the neonate.

Urine culture, a routine part of the sepsis evaluation for\\nlate-onset disease, is rarely useful in the first few days of life.\\nAntibiotics that provide broad-spectrum coverage, typically ampicillin and gentamicin in the first\\nfew days of life, should be continued for 48–72 hours pending the results of all cultures that were sent\\nfor analysis. Vancomycin and \\ngentamicin are often used for nosocomial infections. If bacteremia is\\ndocumented by a positive blood culture or highly suspected based on clinical status or laboratory\\nfindings, antibiotics should be continued for 7–10 days.

Conjunctivitis\\nInfection of the conjunctiva may occur within the first few weeks of life. Prophylaxis with\\nerythromycin 0.5% ophthalmic ointment immediately after delivery is now a standard part of newborn\\ncare. Conjunctivitis usually presents with injection of the conjunctiva and discharge from the eye,\\nusually bilaterally, in the first week of life. Erythema of the conjunctiva helps differentiate\\nconjunctivitis from lacrimal duct obstruction, a common cause of eye discharge in the neonate.\\nChlamydia trachomatis\\n and \\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae\\n are the most notable causes of neonatal\\nconjunctivitis. Maternal treatment of either infection during pregnancy reduces the risk of infection in\\nthe neonate.

Between 80% and 90% of children born to mothers who are both hepatitis B surface antigen\\n(HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) positive will become infected, and 90% of those infants\\nwill become chronic HBV carriers. Transmission falls to less than 25% if HBeAg is negative and to\\n12% if anti-HBe is present. Babies born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive hepatitis B\\nimmune globulin (HBIg) and the hepatitis B vaccine within 12 hours of delivery. If the mother’s\\nstatus is unknown at the time of delivery, the newborn should receive the vaccine within 12 hours of\\nlife. If the newborn weighs more than 2 kg, HBIg can be deferred for up to 7 days to allow\\ndetermination of the mother’s status according to the AAP \\nRed Book\\n guidelines. However, given the\\nless reliable immune response to vaccine in the preterm host, HBIg should not be deferred in patients\\nweighing less than 2 kg. Appropriate postexposure prophylaxis in the newborn has been shown to\\nprevent transmission in 95% of exposures.\\nPerinatal infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) now accounts for almost all new\\ninfections in preadolescents in the United States.

The infant\\nof a diabetic mother (IDM) is at increased risk for congenital malformations, macrosomia, birth\\ninjury, and a number of postnatal complications, such as RDS, polycythemia, and hypoglycemia. With\\nimproved obstetric monitoring and neonatal care, perinatal mortality has decreased significantly over\\nthe past few decades. With decreased losses from stillbirths, perinatal \\nasphyxia, and RDS, congenital\\nmalformations now represent the single most important cause of perinatal mortality and severe\\nmorbidity in IDMs.\\nStudies have shown that IDMs have a 2- to 8-fold higher risk of a structural malformation\\ncompared to infants born to nondiabetic mothers. The most common malformations in IDMs are\\nneural tube defects, CHD, renal anomalies, and abnormalities of the genitourinary tract. The exact\\npathogenesis of the malformations is unclear, but various mechanisms, including altered levels of\\narachidonic acid and/or myoinositol, free-radical damage, and altered gene expression have been\\nproposed. The risk of structural malformations has been clearly shown to correlate with poor glycemic\\ncontrol in the first trimester. Consequently, tight control of glucose levels must begin prior to\\nconception in order to decrease the risk of structural malformations.\\nMetabolic alterations seen in IDMs are more closely associated with glycemic control later in\\npregnancy. Elevated maternal glucose levels result in elevated fetal glucose levels that produce\\nhyperinsulinism in the fetus. Insulin is a growth factor, and abnormal exposure to insulin results in\\nfetal macrosomia. After delivery, the hyperinsulinemic state persists, but there is no longer an\\nongoing supply of glucose coming across the placenta; the newborn is thus at risk for hypoglycemia.\\nIDMs should be closely monitored after birth to ensure that glucose requirements are met.

Hyperglycemia and the resulting hyperinsulinemia in the fetus\\ngenerate a catabolic state, causing oxygen consumption. Erythropoiesis is believed to occur as a\\nresponse to fetal hypoxia.\\nAsymmetric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a frequent finding in IDMs. The cardiomyopathy may\\nbe asymptomatic, apparent only as cardiomegaly on CXR, or it may be clinically significant, usually\\nas a result of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and/or poor ventricular filling and cardiac\\noutput related to hypertrophy of the ventricular septum. The hypertrophy of the cardiac muscle\\nresolves over time, and the only indicated treatment is supportive care.\\nIntrauterine Growth Restriction\\nIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) describes a pattern of aberrant and reduced fetal growth that is\\nidentified by prenatal ultrasound examinations. The growth restriction is classified as asymmetric if\\nthe head circumference, used as a marker for brain growth, is spared. IUGR refers to growth in utero,\\nand IUGR newborns may or may not be small for gestational age (SGA). (The definition of SGA\\nvaries, but historically it has been defined as less than the 10th percentile for gestational age at birth.)\\nIUGR can result from a range of processes that may originate with the fetus (chromosomal\\nabnormalities, fetal gender, genetic inheritance, TORCH infection), the placenta (abnormal\\nimplantation or insertion of the cord, preeclampsia, placental insufficiency), or the mother (chronic\\ndisease such as diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, or cyanotic heart disease; smoking; abnormal\\nuterine anatomy; low pregnancy weight gain). The etiology of IUGR in approximately 40% of patients\\nis never determined. CMV and toxoplasmosis studies are sometimes sent for affected newborns to\\ndetermine an infectious cause. However, given the number of idiopathic cases of IUGR, some have\\nquestioned the utility of sending these cultures for infants with no physical examination or imaging\\nstudy findings suggestive of congenital infection. Prenatal management of the IUGR fetus is impacted\\nby the increased risk of intrauterine demise and perinatal asphyxia with IUGR, but also requires\\nconsideration of the fact that gestational age at birth is still a major determinant of outcome in the\\npremature growth-restricted infant. There is currently great interest in the connection between low\\nbirth weight and the development of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease in\\nadulthood.\\nThe Dysmorphic Infant\\nIt is estimated that 2% of all newborns have a serious congenital malformation. Advances in prenatal\\ncare now allow for early diagnosis of many congenital birth defects or diseases, but many are still\\ndifficult or impossible to detect in utero. Dysmorphic features and structural abnormalities may be\\nimmediately apparent, or they may be subtle and identified only upon close inspection. Every newborn\\nshould undergo a thorough examination to identify features suggestive of underlying pathology,\\ngenetic abnormalities, or specific syndromes or disorders.\\nTransfer of the newborn to a referral center where an evaluation by a clinical geneticist or\\ndysmorphologist can be conducted may be warranted if significant abnormalities are present.

The\\ncatheter allows simultaneous measurement of central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary artery\\npressure (PAP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), cardiac output, and mixed venous\\noxygen saturation. The pulmonary artery catheter is a 7F triple-lumen polyvinyl chloride catheter with\\na balloon and thermodilution cardiac output sensor at the tip. The distal port is used to measure PAP\\nwhen the balloon is deflated and PCWP when inflated. A proximal lumen is present 30 cm from the\\nballoon tip; this can be used to monitor the CVP and to administer fluids and drugs. Both ports can be\\nused to withdraw blood.

The cardiac output is inversely proportional to the fall in temperature and is computed by\\nplanimetric or computerized methods. The average of 3 values within 10% of each other is typically\\nutilized to calculate cardiac output.\\nB. Systemic Vascular Resistance\\nSystemic vascular resistance (SVR) represents the total resistance to forward flow of blood through\\nthe body’s vascular tree. SVR is calculated as follows:\\nDuring pregnancy, this parameter is usually in the range of 800–1200 dynes · s · cm\\n–5\\n. Depending\\non the clinical condition, a reduction or increase in SVR may be desirable in the presence of normal\\nblood pressure (eg, septic shock), in which a very low SVR may be seen despite normal or low blood\\npressure. In order to maintain vital organ perfusion, vasopressor therapy may be indicated to increase\\nSVR.\\nC. Pulmonary Capillary Wedge Pressure\\nThe PCWP provides important information on 2 basic parameters of cardiopulmonary function: (1)\\npulmonary venous pressure, which is a major determinant of pulmonary congestion; and (2) the left\\natrial and left ventricular filling pressures, from which ventricular function curves can be constructed.\\nPulmonary capillary wedge pressure can be reliably assessed by CVP monitoring only in the\\nabsence of significant myocardial dysfunction. The measurement of PCWP has certain advantages\\nover measurement of CVP alone. A disparity between right and left ventricular function may be seen\\nin conditions such as myocardial infarction, valvular disease, sepsis, and severe PIH. Under these\\ncircumstances, the management of fluid therapy based on CVP alone could have adverse results.\\nAdditionally, cardiac output and mixed venous oxygen tension cannot be determined with a simple\\nCVP catheter.\\nD. Ventricular Function Curves\\nMyocardial performance is best interpreted in terms of left ventricular function curves (ie, the Frank-\\nStarling relationship). The cardiac output and PCWP are used to construct \\nthe ventricular function\\ncurve by plotting the ventricular stroke work index against the mean atrial pressure or ventricular end-\\ndiastolic pressure (usually the PCWP). The left ventricular stroke work index is calculated by the\\nfollowing formula:\\n(LVSWI = left ventricular stroke work index [g-m/m\\n2\\n]; SVI = stroke volume index [mL/beat/m\\n2\\n];\\nMAP = mean arterial pressure [mm Hg]; PCWP = pulmonary capillary wedge pressure [mm Hg]).\\nVentricular function curves provide a useful index of cardiovascular status to guide inotropic and\\nvasoactive drug therapy. Evaluation of myocardial contractility by ventricular function curves allows\\none to obtain optimal filling pressures and stroke volume index in critically ill patients. The effects of\\ntherapy (eg, diuretics, antihypertensive agents, or volume expanders) can be evaluated on the basis of'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='performance. Under normal conditions, a small rise in filling pressure is accompanied by a rapid rise\\nin stroke work. Unfavorable conditions such as hypoxia or myocardial depression produce a shift in\\nthe curve to the right and downward such that lower stroke work indices are seen at higher filling\\npressures.\\nE. Mixed Venous Oxygen Saturation\\nThe mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO\\n2\\n) reflects the body’s capacity to provide adequate tissue\\noxygenation. This parameter is affected by cardiac output, hemoglobin concentration, arterial oxygen\\nsaturation, and tissue oxygen consumption. An SvO\\n2\\n of 60–80% usually indicates normal oxygen\\ndelivery and demand with adequate tissue perfusion. An SvO\\n2\\n greater than 80% reflects increased\\noxygen delivery and decreased oxygen utilization. This situation may be seen in patients with\\nhypothermia or sepsis who are receiving supplemental oxygen. A high SvO\\n2\\n may also provide\\nconfirmatory evidence that the pulmonary artery catheter is in the wedge position. Finally, a low SvO\\n2\\n(<60%) indicates increased oxygen demands with decreased oxygen delivery due to anemia, low\\ncardiac output, or decreased arterial oxygen saturation.\\nMeasurement of SvO\\n2\\n allows for continuous monitoring of cardiorespiratory reserve by providing\\nan index of tissue oxygen delivery and utilization. Changes in SvO\\n2\\n will be apparent with infusion of\\nvasoactive drugs, volume loading, or afterload reduction. Although many intensive care units rely on\\ndirect measurement of cardiac output alone, this parameter does not always accurately reflect tissue\\noxygenation. For instance, normal cardiac output might not be adequate to meet increased oxygen\\nrequirements in malignant hyperthermia or thyroid storm.\\nF. Maternal Oxygen Consumption\\nMixed venous oxygen saturation results can be used with arterial blood gas analysis to provide useful\\ninformation about the metabolic status of the critically ill obstetric \\npatient. Resting maternal oxygen\\nconsumption progressively increases during pregnancy. Occasionally, one needs to pay particular\\nattention to the metabolic status of critically ill women or those with ARDS. Factors such as\\ntachycardia or fever that are associated with increased oxygen consumption should be minimized\\nunder these circumstances.\\nThe Fick relationship:\\nprovides a method for calculating oxygen consumption (VO\\n2\\n), if the cardiac output (CO) and systemic\\narteriovenous oxygen (AvO\\n2\\n) concentration difference is known. The AvO\\n2\\n difference can be\\ncalculated by subtracting the oxygen content of desaturated mixed venous blood from that of arterial\\nblood that passes through the pulmonary artery catheter. For example, a patient with a cardiac output\\nminus AvO\\n2\\n difference of 5 mL would have an oxygen consumption (VO\\n2\\n) of 300 mL.\\nAn understanding of these relationships will allow the clinician to better understand how to use\\nphysiologic variables for interpreting the hemodynamic and pulmonary condition of critically ill\\npatients.'),\n",

Colloid Osmotic Pressure\\nThe plasma colloid oncotic pressure (COP) is another measurement that can be useful in critical care\\n(\\nTable 23–2\\n). Plasma COP is the pressure exerted by certain plasma proteins that hold fluid in the\\nintravascular space. Albumin accounts for 75% of the oncotic pressure of plasma, with the rest\\ncoming from globulin and fibrinogen. It has been demonstrated in dogs that iatrogenic reduction in\\nplasma proteins resulted in pulmonary edema with only minimal increases in left atrial pressure.\\nSubsequent studies in humans identified cases of pulmonary edema in which normal or slightly\\nelevated PCWP was present. From these studies, the important concept of a COP-PCWP gradient\\nevolved.

The American College of\\nObstetricians and Gynecologists defines septic shock as sepsis with hypotension despite adequate\\nfluid resuscitation, with the presence of perfusion abnormalities including (but not limited to) lactic\\nacidosis and oliguria. The incidence of bacteremia in obstetric patients has been estimated to be\\nbetween 0.7% and 10%. Although gramnegative bacteria are usually responsible for most of these\\ninfections, septic shock may also result from infection with other bacteria, fungi, protozoa, or viruses.\\nThe most common cause of obstetric septic shock is postoperative endometritis (85%). Other\\ncommonly associated conditions include antepartum pyelonephritis, septic abortion, and\\nchorioamnionitis.\\nSepsis may lead to a systemic inflammatory response that can be triggered not only by infections,\\nbut also by noninfectious disorders, such as trauma and pancreatitis. However, there is strong evidence\\nto support the concept that endotoxin is responsible for the pathogenesis of gramnegative septic shock.\\nEscherichia coli\\n has been implicated in 25–50% of cases of septic hypotension, but a variety of other\\norganisms may be causative, including \\nKlebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Proteus, Pseudomonas,\\nStreptococcus, Peptostreptococcus, Staphylococcus, Fusobacterium, Clostridium\\n, and \\nBacteroides\\n.\\nThe gramnegative endotoxin theory does not explain gram-positive shock, although an understanding\\nof the proposed mechanisms will serve to exemplify the multisystemic effects of this disorder.\\nEndotoxin is a complex lipopolysaccharide present in the cell walls of gramnegative bacteria. The\\nactive component of endotoxin, lipid A, is responsible for initiating activation of the coagulation,\\nfibrinolysis, complement, prostaglandin, and kinin systems. Activation of the coagulation and\\nfibrinolysis systems may lead to consumptive coagulopathy. Complement activation leads to the\\nrelease by leukocytes of mediators that are responsible for damage to vascular endothelium, platelet\\naggregation, intensification of the coagulation cascade, and degranulation of mast cells with histamine\\nrelease. Histamine will cause increased capillary permeability, decreased plasma volume,\\nvasodilatation, and hypotension. Release of bradykinin and β-endorphins also contributes to systemic\\nhypotension. Early stages of septic shock involve low SVR and high cardiac output with a relative\\ndecrease in intravascular volume. Late or cold shock subsequently involves an endogenous myocardial\\ndepressant factor that has not been isolated. This factor is associated with decreased cardiac output\\nand continued low SVR in the absence of pressor agents. Recent studies suggest that tumor necrosis\\nfactor (TNF) may lead to depressed myocardial function during septic shock. Monocytes and\\nmacrophages incubated with endotoxin produce this 17-kDa polypeptide within 40 minutes. Direct\\ninjection of TNF into animals leads to many of the changes seen in endotoxic shock. Other possible\\nfactors include interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, interferon gamma, and granulocyte stimulating factor.'),\n",

Symptoms and Signs\\nSeptic shock can be divided into 3 stages: preshock, early shock (warm shock), and late (or cold)\\nshock.

Their condition is best described as a moderate\\nhyperdynamic state, with elevated cardiac output, decreasing SVR, and normal blood pressures.\\nResponse to therapy will be greatest at this stage.

Altered mental status, temperature instability, and sinusoidal fluctuations in arterial blood\\npressure may be seen at this stage. As this condition progresses into late shock, activation of the\\nsympathetic nervous system with release of catecholamines will lead to intense vasoconstriction,\\nwhich serves to shunt blood from the peripheral tissues to the heart and brain (cold shock). The\\ncompensatory vasoconstriction results in increased cardiac work.

Correction of maternal acidosis, hypoxemia, and systemic hypotension will usually improve\\nany abnormalities in the fetal heart tracing.\\nB. Cardiovascular Support\\nAggressive treatment of obstetric septic shock must rapidly and effectively reverse organ\\nhypoperfusion, improve oxygen delivery, and correct acidosis. Priority should be given to\\ncardiopulmonary support with the additional understanding that other major organ systems can also be\\nseverely affected.\\nA sequential hemodynamic approach for stabilizing obstetric septic shock with volume repletion,\\ninotropic therapy, and peripheral vasoconstrictors is recommended. Volume therapy initially begins\\nwith 1–2 L of lactated Ringer’s solution infused over approximately 15 minutes. However, it is\\nimportant that volume infusion not be withheld in a hypotensive patient pending placement of a\\npulmonary artery catheter. The total amount of crystalloid administered should be guided by the\\npresence or absence of maternal hypoxemia secondary to pulmonary edema and left ventricular filling\\npressures, as estimated by PCWP.\\nIn general, myocardial performance will be optimized according to the Starling mechanism at a\\nPCWP of 14–16 mm Hg. Such preload optimization is mandatory before the initiation of inotropic\\ntherapy. Blood component therapy can also be an important adjunctive measure if the patient has\\nexperienced significant hemorrhage and has developed an associated coagulopathy.\\nIf the shock state persists despite volume replacement and adequate hemostasis, efforts should be\\ndirected toward improving myocardial performance and vascular tone. Inotropic agents such as\\ndopamine, dobutamine, or isoproterenol are excellent choices for improving myocardial contractility\\nin an obstetric patient with a failing heart (\\nTable 23–4\\n). We recommend dopamine as the first-line\\ndrug of choice for treating septic hypotension when inotropic therapy is indicated. This substance is a\\nchemical precursor of norepinephrine that has alpha-adrenergic, beta-adrenergic, and dopaminergic\\nreceptor stimulating actions. The dopamine infusion is initiated at 2–5 μg/kg/min and titrated against\\nits effect on improving cardiac output and blood pressure in patients with obstetric septic shock. At\\nlow doses (0.5–5.0 μg/kg/min), this sympathomimetic amine acts primarily on the dopaminergic\\nreceptors, leading to vasodilation and improved perfusion of the renal and mesenteric vascular beds.\\nHigher dopamine doses (5.0–15.0 μg/kg/min) are associated with predominant effects on the β'),\n",

Vasoconstrictive action associated with high doses of infused dopamine can actually\\nbe detrimental to organ perfusion and will rarely be useful under these clinical circumstances.\\nAlthough myocardial performance after dopamine therapy is best evaluated by ventricular function\\ncurves, it is reasonable to maintain a systemic cardiac index above 3 L/min/m\\n2\\n.\\nTable 23–4\\n.

Thus enhanced communication between the amniotic fluid sac and the maternal venous\\nsystem is necessary for amniotic fluid embolism to occur. Sites of entry may include endocervical\\nveins lacerated during normal labor, a disrupted placental implantation site, and traumatized uterine\\nveins. \\nSquamous cells and trophoblastic tissue are often found in the maternal pulmonary vasculature\\nof patients who underwent pulmonary artery catheterization.

If meconium is present, a more dramatic response is\\nseen. Fetal demise has also been shown to worsen this condition. Once amniotic debris enters the\\nvenous system, it travels rapidly to the cardiopulmonary circulation, leading to shock and arterial\\nhypoxemia. Myocardial dysfunction may result from ischemic injury or right ventricular dilatation.\\nSome experimental evidence suggests that amniotic fluid may have a direct myocardial depressant\\neffect.

These mediators are seen in other shock states such\\nas sepsis and anaphylaxis, leading Clark to suggest that amniotic fluid embolism be termed\\n“anaphylactoid syndrome of pregnancy.” The effects of systemic hypotension and hypoxemia may\\nlead to cardiopulmonary collapse, renal insufficiency, hepatic failure, seizures, and coma.\\nAmniotic fluid embolism is almost always associated with some form of DIC. The etiology of\\ncoagulopathy associated with amniotic fluid embolism is incompletely understood, but it is known\\nthat amniotic fluid has potent total thromboplastin and antifibrinolytic activity, both of which increase\\nwith advancing gestational age. Once clotting is triggered in the pulmonary vasculature, local\\nthrombin generation can cause vasoconstriction and microvascular thrombosis.\\nLimited hemodynamic observations with pulmonary artery catheterization suggest that in humans\\nwith amniotic fluid embolism, left ventricular dysfunction is the only significant hemodynamic\\nalteration that is consistently documented. The response to amniotic fluid embolus in humans may be\\nbiphasic, initially resulting in intense vasospasm, severe pulmonary hypertension, and hypoxia.

Laboratory Findings\\nArterial blood oxygen tension typically indicates severe maternal hypoxemia. This hypoxemia may\\nresult from ventilationperfusion inequality with atelectasis and associated pulmonary edema. The\\ndiagnosis of significant coagulopathy is manifested by the presence of microangiopathic hemolysis,\\nhypofibrinogenemia, prolonged clotting times, prolonged bleeding time, and elevated fibrin split\\nproducts. The chest radiograph is nonspecific, although pulmonary edema is often noted. The ECG\\ntypically reveals unexplained tachycardia, nonspecific ST- and T-wave changes, and a right\\nventricular strain pattern. Lung scans occasionally identify perfusion defects resulting from amniotic\\nfluid embolism even though chest radiographic findings are normal.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nMany conditions may mimic the effects of amniotic fluid embolism on the respiratory,\\ncardiovascular, and coagulation systems. Pulmonary thromboembolism can result in severe\\nhypoxemia with pulmonary edema. In contrast to amniotic fluid embolism, chest pain is a relatively\\ncommon finding. Congestive heart failure due to fluid overload or preexisting heart disease may\\nmimic the cardiorespiratory compromise observed during amniotic fluid embolism. Hypotension may\\nresult from several disorders, including septic chorioamnionitis or postpartum hemorrhage.\\nPulmonary aspiration (Mendelson’s syndrome) is associated with tachycardia, shock, respiratory\\ndistress, and production of a frothy pink sputum, but is usually also associated with bronchospasm and\\nwheezing. Other conditions in the differential diagnosis include air embolism, myocardial infarction,\\nanaphylaxis, placental abruption, eclampsia, uterine rupture, transfusion reaction, and local anesthesia\\ntoxicity.\\nTreatment\\nAmniotic fluid embolism remains one of the most devastating and unpreventable conditions\\ncomplicating pregnancy. Therapeutic measures are supportive and should be directed toward\\nminimizing hypoxemia with supplemental oxygen, \\nmaintaining blood pressure, and managing\\nassociated coagulopathies. Patients with poor oxygenation often require intubation and positive end-\\nexpiratory pressure. Adequate oxygenation will minimize related cerebral and myocardial ischemia\\nand acidosis-induced pulmonary artery vasospasm. Pulmonary artery catheterization should be\\nconsidered in the absence of coagulopathy to guide inotropic therapy with dopamine. If invasive\\nhemodynamic monitoring is not available, rapid digitalization should be considered. Finally, the\\ndevelopment of consumptive coagulopathy may require replacement of depleted hemostatic\\ncomponents in cases with significant uncontrollable bleeding or abnormal clotting parameters.\\nPrognosis\\nMaternal mortality rates range from 60–80%; however, a recent study quoted a 26.4% mortality rate.\\nOf those patients who do not survive, 25% die within the first hour, and 80% within the first 9 hours.\\nCorrespondingly high perinatal morbidity and mortality rates would be expected.'),\n",

Mortality has been documented as 12.8% if untreated and 0.7% if\\ntherapy is instituted. The diagnosis of deepvenous thrombosis (DVT) occurs in the antepartum period\\napproximately half the time and is evenly distributed throughout each trimester. Pulmonary embolism\\nhas a higher incidence in the postpartum period. Predisposing factors commonly include advanced\\nmaternal age, obesity, traumatic delivery, abdominal delivery, thrombophlebitis, and endometritis.\\nPatients with underlying thrombophilias or previous thrombotic events are at greater risk for this\\ncondition.\\nMore than 100 years ago, Virchow postulated that the basic mechanism of thrombus formation is\\nrelated to a combination of vessel injury, vascular stasis, and alterations in blood coagulability.\\nVenous thrombi consist of fibrin deposits and red blood cells with varying amounts of platelet and\\nwhite blood cell components. In most cases, lower extremity and pelvic thrombi are responsible for\\nthe pathologic sequelae.\\nOrdinarily, the vascular endothelium does not react with either platelets or the blood coagulation\\nsystem unless it is disrupted by vessel injury. Such injury exposes subendothelial cells to blood\\nelements responsible for activation of the extrinsic coagulation cascade. Disruption of the vascular\\nendothelium may occur during traumatic vaginal delivery or caesarean section.\\nPregnancy is associated with venous stasis, especially in the lower extremities, because the\\nenlarging uterus reduces blood return to the inferior vena cava by direct mechanical effects. Hormonal\\nfactors may also contribute to vasodilatation and stasis during pregnancy. Stasis prevents the hepatic\\nclearance of activated coagulation factors and minimizes mixing of these factors with their serum\\ninhibitors. In this manner, venous stasis becomes another predisposing factor for the formation of\\nthrombi. Stasis secondary to prolonged bedrest for medical or obstetric complications will predispose\\na pregnant woman to increased venous stasis and formation of vascular thrombi. The period of\\ngreatest risk for thrombosis and embolism appears to be the immediate postpartum, especially after\\ncaesarean delivery.\\nThe maternal circulation becomes hypercoagulable from alterations in the coagulation and\\nfibrinolytic systems.

The most\\ncommonly recognized thrombophilia in the white population is factor V Leiden mutation (5%). Other\\nless common but significant disorders include prothrombin gene mutation G20210A (2–4%),\\nantithrombin III deficiency (0.02–0.2%), protein C deficiency (0.2–0.5%), protein S deficiency\\n(0.08%), and hyperhomocysteinemia (1%). The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome also significantly\\nincreases maternal risk of thromboembolism and other pregnancy complications.\\nOnce a venous thrombus is formed, it may dislodge from its peripheral vascular origin and enter\\nthe central maternal circulation. Propagation of the original venous clot or recurrent pulmonary\\nemboli are possible. DVTs limited to the calf rarely embolize, but approximately 20% extend to the\\nproximal lower extremity.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\nThe subsequent cardiopulmonary effects of pulmonary embolus will depend on the location and size\\nof thrombi in the lung. A patient with a large embolus affecting the central pulmonary circulation may\\npresent with acute syncope, respiratory distress, and shock. Smaller emboli may not have significant\\nclinical sequelae.\\nNo single symptom or combination of symptoms is sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of\\npulmonary embolus. Classic triads (hemoptysis, chest pain, and dyspnea; or dyspnea, chest pain, and\\napprehension) are rarely seen (\\nTable 23–5\\n).

Laboratory Findings\\nThere are no specific routine laboratory findings associated with the diagnosis of pulmonary embolus,\\nalthough arterial blood gas measurements will often reveal significant hypoxemia. In the upright\\nposition, almost all healthy young pregnant women will have an arterial blood oxygen tension greater\\nthan 90 mm Hg. An alveolar-atrial (A-a) gradient of greater than 20 is suspicious for pulmonary\\nembolus. The ECG may reveal unexplained tachycardia associated with cor pulmonale (right axis\\ndeviation, S wave in lead I, Q wave plus T wave inversion in lead III). A chest roentgenogram may be\\nnormal or may show infiltrates, atelectasis, or effusions. Thirty percent of patients with a pulmonary\\nembolus will have a normal chest x-ray.\\nIt is generally accepted that a normal radionuclide perfusion study can effectively rule out\\npulmonary embolus. Perfusion studies are occasionally equivocal, and ventilation scanning may be\\nrequired to clarify the diagnosis. Ventilation scanning will improve the specificity of the perfusion\\nstudy, because this will rule out airway disorders that may be responsible for reduced pulmonary\\nperfusion.

Preventive Treatment\\nOnce predisposing risk factors to pulmonary embolus are identified, it is important to minimize the\\npossibility of further complications. In patients at higher risk for DVT, prophylactic measures should\\nbe directed toward preventing venous stasis that leads to clot formation. Mechanical maneuvers such\\nas raising the lower extremities 15 degrees above the horizontal, keeping the legs straight rather than\\nbent at the knees when sitting, or performing calf flexion exercises may be useful, as may external\\npneumatic compression. One method used to prevent perioperative thrombophlebitis includes\\nminidose heparin prophylaxis, 5000 U subcutaneously 2 hours before surgery and every 12 hours until\\nroutine ambulation is achieved. Minidose heparin prophylaxis significantly decreases not only the\\nincidence of DVT but also the incidence of fatal pulmonary emboli. Subcutaneous minidose heparin\\nmay be reinstituted approximately 6 hours after delivery. Postpartum or postoperative ambulation is\\nimportant in minimizing thromboembolic complications during this high-risk period. Some women\\nmay require therapeutic anticoagulation during pregnancy to prevent a thromboembolic event.\\nIncluded in this category are women with artificial heart valves, antithrombin III deficiency,\\nantiphospholipid antibody syndrome, history of rheumatic heart disease and atrial fibrillation,\\nhomozygosity for factor V Leiden or prothrombin gene mutation, and recurrent thromboembolic\\ndisease. Therapeutic anticoagulation can be achieved by using subcutaneous heparin 2–3 times a day,\\nadjusting for a PTT of 2.0–3.0 times normal. Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) can also be\\nused. LMWH does not cross the placenta, and it has been shown to be relatively safe in pregnancy. In\\naddition, complications of heparin therapy (osteoporosis, thrombocytopenia) are less common with\\nthis medication, and dosing in pregnancy usually may require fewer adjustments. The PTT does not\\nneed to be followed; instead, peak antifactor Xa levels can be checked every 4–6 weeks. It is\\ncontroversial whether other disorders, such as protein C or S deficiency, or a family history of\\nthrombophilias, require anticoagulation therapy.

The PTT should be\\nmaintained at 1.5–2.5 times control values. Other investigators recommend the use of heparin levels\\nfor monitoring anticoagulation therapy. Heparin levels may be measured on the third or fourth day and\\nshould be approximately 0.2 μg/mL, not to exceed 0.4 μg/mL. Alternatively, LMWH can also be used\\nfor therapeutic anticoagulation. Leg elevation, bedrest, and local heat will be beneficial to patients\\nwho have associated DVT. Intravenous morphine may be helpful in alleviating anxiety and\\nameliorating chest pain.\\nIntrapartum care of pulmonary embolus is complicated, and individual treatment approaches may\\nvary. Selected patients with recent pulmonary thromboembolism, ileo-femoral DVT, or heart valve\\nprosthesis should probably continue full anticoagulation with high-dose heparin during labor or\\nsurgical procedures. Under these circumstances, the risk for potential bleeding complications from\\nanticoagulant needs to be balanced against the risk of thromboembolism. Although there is a higher\\nincidence of wound hematomas associated with peripartum anticoagulation, there is no clear evidence\\nthat this regimen is associated with excessive postpartum hemorrhage after normal vaginal delivery.\\nPostpartum patients receiving heparin may be switched over to warfarin once oral intake is\\ntolerated. Warfarin is considered safe during breastfeeding. Heparin should be continued for the first\\n5–7 days of warfarin therapy. By the time heparin is discontinued, the international normalized ratio\\nshould be 2.0–3.0 times the normal value. Alternatively, it may be desirable to continue moderate\\ndoses of subcutaneous heparin (10,000 U twice daily) or LMWH. Postpartum anticoagulation should\\nbe continued for at least 3 months if the patient developed pulmonary embolus in the third trimester.\\nC. Complications of Treatment\\nThe major complication of anticoagulant therapy is maternal or fetal hemorrhage. Heparin does not\\ncross the placenta due to its large molecular weight, but it has been associated with \\nmaternal\\nthrombocytopenia and osteoporosis. These effects can be reduced with LMWH. Warfarin is known to\\ncross the placental barrier, and its use in the first trimester has been associated with embryopathy\\n(nasal hypoplasia and stippled epiphyses) in approximately 5–8% of fetuses. Fetal nervous system\\nabnormalities (eg, hydrocephalus) have also been noted with the use of warfarin during pregnancy.\\nA small percentage of patients will experience recurrent pulmonary emboli despite full\\nanticoagulation. These patients may be candidates for vena caval ligation by a transabdominal\\napproach under general or regional anesthesia. If the pelvis is suspected as the source of embolus, the\\nright ovarian vein should also be ligated. It has been estimated that approximately 95% of patients\\nwith pulmonary embolism massive enough to cause hypotension eventually die. In this context,\\npulmonary artery embolectomy may be life-saving.\\nPlacement of a vena caval umbrella via the internal jugular vein is an option for unstable patients\\nwith recurrent emboli who would not be prime surgical candidates. Although abdominal radiography\\nis required for this procedure, placement of the umbrella filter does not require general anesthesia.\\nThis strategy will prevent larger emboli from reaching the pulmonary circulation.\\nPrognosis\\nPulmonary embolus, with a mortality rate of 12–15% if left untreated, will develop in approximately\\none-fourth of untreated patients with antenatal DVT. In a review of pregnancies complicated by DVT\\ntreated with anticoagulant therapy, the incidence of pulmonary embolus was 4.5% of patients, with a\\nmaternal mortality rate of less than 1%.'),\n",

The intrinsic system\\ncontains all the intravascular components required to activate thrombin by sequential activation of\\nfactors XII, XI, IX, X, V, and II (prothrombin). The extrinsic system is initially activated by tissue\\nthromboplastin, leading to sequential activation of factors VII, X, V, and prothrombin.

This central enzyme is capable of activating factor XIII to\\nstabilize the newly formed fibrin clot and will enhance the activity of factors V and VIII.\\nActivation of the coagulation system also stimulates the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin as a\\nprotective mechanism against intravascular thrombosis. Plasmin is an enzyme that inactivates factors\\nV and VIII and is capable of lysing fibrin and fibrinogen to form degradation products. Thus the\\nnormal physiologic hemostatic mechanism represents a delicate and complex balance between the\\ncoagulation and fibrinolytic systems.\\nPregnancy is considered to represent a hypercoagulable state. With the exception of factors XI and\\nXIII, there is an overall increase in the activity of coagulation factors. Fibrinogen rises as early as 12\\nweeks’ gestation and reaches a peak level of 400–650 mg/dL in late pregnancy.

All\\nthese mechanisms may contribute to development of a bleeding diathesis resulting from increased\\nthrombin activity. Additionally, widespread DIC will cause increased platelet aggregation,\\nconsumption of coagulation factors, secondary activation of the fibrinolytic system, and deposition of\\nfibrin into multiple organ sites, which can result in ischemic tissue damage.

Clotting time and clot retraction\\n—Observation of clotting time and ability of the clot to retract\\ncan be performed by using 2 mL of blood in a 5-mL glass test tube. These are relatively simple\\nbedside tests that can provide qualitative evidence of hypofibrinogenemia. When the clot forms, it is\\nusually soft but not reduced in volume (adding celite will hasten this reaction).

ARDS appears to occur more commonly in obstetric\\npatients than in the general population. Its incidence in the nonpregnant population is 1.5 per 100,000,\\nbut it has been estimated to occur in between 1 in 3000 and 1 in 10,000 pregnant patients. ARDS has\\nmany causes, including gastric aspiration, amniotic fluid embolism, sepsis, coagulopathy, massive\\nblood transfusion, and shock. It can be easily confused with cardiogenic pulmonary edema secondary\\nto alterations in preload, myocardial contractility, or afterload. A basic understanding of the\\ndifferences between cardiogenic and noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is essential before rational\\ntherapeutic intervention may be implemented.\\nThe basic underlying pathologic change responsible for ARDS is lung injury that results in damage\\nto the pulmonary epithelium and endothelial tissue. This, in turn, leads to enhanced vascular\\npermeability. Factors determining the net flux of lung fluid between the capillary lumen and\\ninterstitial space are quantitatively related by the Starling equation:\\n(k = filtration coefficient, Pcap = pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure, Pis = interstitial space\\nhydrostatic pressure, πcap = pulmonary capillary serum colloid osmotic pressure, πis = interstitial'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='space fluid colloid osmotic pressure)\\nNormally, fluid flows from the capillary system to the interstitial space and is returned to the\\nsystemic circulation by the pulmonary lymphatic system. An increase in left atrial pressure is\\nobserved when the left ventricle is unable to pump all the returning blood into the left atrium.\\nAccordingly, the pulmonary capillary hydrostatic pressure increases, facilitating net movement of\\nlung fluid into the interstitial space. When capillary fluid efflux into the interstitial space exceeds\\nlymphatic resorption, the clinical presentation of pulmonary edema will occur. Although colloid\\nosmotic pressure in the interstitial space and serum also plays a role in pulmonary edema, the most\\ncommon factor is increased capillary hydrostatic pressure secondary to increased preload (fluid\\noverload), afterload (severe hypertension), and decreased myocardial contractility (postpartum\\ncardiomyopathy).\\nCapillary membrane permeability plays a much larger role in the genesis of noncardiogenic\\npulmonary edema (ARDS). Such injury due to hypoxic ischemia, vasoactive substances, chemical\\nirritation, or microthrombi facilitates further efflux of capillary fluid and plasma proteins into the\\ninterstitium. This increase in permeability acutely produces atelectasis and diminished compliance of\\nthe lung, and damage is usually nonuniform. As the functional capability of atelectatic bronchioles\\ndiminishes, shunting and hypoxemia develop.\\nMaternal physiologic changes can contribute to the severity of ARDS. It has been suggested that\\ndecreased extra-thoracic compliance, decreased functional residual capacity, higher oxygen deficit,\\nlimited cardiac output increases, and anemia may adversely affect the clinical presentation and course\\nof ARDS during pregnancy.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\nClassic signs of respiratory distress are tachypnea, intercostal retractions, and even cyanosis,\\ndepending on the degree of hypoxemia. Fetal tachycardia or late decelerations may reflect maternal\\nhypoxemia and uteroplacental insufficiency. Pulmonary rales in noncardiogenic pulmonary edema\\nwill be indistinguishable from those of cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but physical findings consistent\\nwith the cardiogenic disorder (ventricular gallop, jugular venous distention, and peripheral edema) are\\nnot typical features of ARDS. Unfortunately, the physiologic changes of pregnancy may mask the\\nsignificance of these physical findings during the more subtle stages of respiratory distress.\\nB. Laboratory Findings\\nArterial blood gas determinations will reveal a progressive moderate to severe hypoxemia despite\\noxygen therapy. Depending on the obstetric cause of ARDS, other laboratory findings will be variable\\nor nonspecific. The initial chest roentgenogram will often be normal, even in the presence of clinically\\nsignificant respiratory distress. Within the next 24–48 hours, patchy or diffuse infiltrates will progress\\nto prominent alveolar infiltrates (\\nFig. 23–8\\n).

McDonald, MD\\nBiing-Jaw Chen, MD\\nWing-Fai Kwan, MD\\nAnalgesia\\n is the loss or modulation of pain perception. It can be (1) local and affect only a small area\\nof the body, (2) regional and affect a larger portion of the body, or (3) systemic. Analgesia is achieved\\nby the use of hypnosis (suggestion), systemic medication, regional agents, or inhalational agents.\\nAnesthesia\\n is the total loss of sensory perception and may include loss of consciousness. It is\\ninduced by various agents and techniques. In obstetrics, \\nregional anesthesia\\n is accomplished with\\nlocal anesthetic techniques (epidural, spinal) and \\ngeneral anesthesia\\n with systemic medication and\\nendotracheal intubation.\\nThe terms \\nanalgesia\\n and \\nanesthesia\\n are sometimes confused in common usage. Analgesia denotes\\nthose states in which only modulation of pain perception is involved. Anesthesia denotes those states\\nin which mental awareness and perception of other sensations are lost. Attempts have been made to\\ndivide anesthesia into various components, including analgesia, amnesia, relaxation, and loss of reflex\\nresponse to pain. Analgesia can be regarded as a component of anesthesia if viewed in this way.\\nThe use of techniques and medications to provide pain relief in obstetrics requires an expert\\nunderstanding of their effects to ensure the safety of both mother and fetus.\\nANATOMY OF PAIN\\nIt may be academic to argue that pain should be defined as the parturient’s response to the stimuli of\\nlabor, because agreement on a definition of pain has eluded scholars for centuries.\\nNevertheless, it should be appreciated that the “pain response” is a response of the total personality\\nand cannot be dissected systematically and scientifically. Physicians are obligated to provide a\\ncomfortable or at least a tolerable labor and delivery. Many patients are tense and apprehensive at the\\nonset of labor, although they may have little or no discomfort. The physician must be knowledgeable\\nof the options for pain relief and respond to the patient’s needs and wishes.\\nThe evolution of pain in the first stage of labor originally was described as involving spinal\\nsegments T11 and T12. Subsequent research has determined that segments T10–L1 are involved.\\nDiscomfort is associated with ischemia of the uterus during contraction as well as dilatation and\\neffacement of the cervix. Sensory pathways that convey nociceptive impulses of the first stage of\\nlabor include the uterine plexus, the inferior hypogastric plexus, the middle hypogastric plexus, the\\nsuperior hypogastric plexus, the lumbar and lower thoracic sympathetic chain, and the T10–L1 spinal\\nsegments.\\nPain in the second stage of labor also is produced by distention of the vagina and perineum.\\nSensory pathways from these areas are conveyed by branches of the pudendal nerve via the dorsal\\nnerve of the clitoris, the labial nerves, and the inferior hemorrhoidal nerves. These are the major\\nsensory branches to the perineum and are conveyed along nerve roots S2, S3, and S4.

The type of pain\\nreported may be an ache in the back or loins (referred pain, perhaps from the cervix), a cramp in the\\nuterus (due to fundal contraction), or a “bursting” or “splitting” sensation in the lower vaginal canal or\\npudendum (due to dilatation of the cervix and vagina).\\nDystocia, which usually is painful, may be due to feto-pelvic disproportion; tetanic, prolonged, or\\ndysrhythmic uterine contractions; intrapartum infection; or many other causes.\\nSAFETY OF OBSTETRIC ANESTHESIA\\nSubstantial advances in the quality and safety of obstetric anesthesia have been made in the past 3\\ndecades. Outdated techniques, such as “twilight sleep” and mask anesthesia, have been recognized as\\nineffective or unsafe and have been replaced by epidural infusion of narcotic/local anesthesia mixtures\\nand patient-controlled analgesia during labor and postoperatively. When required, general anesthesia\\nis provided using short-acting drugs with well-known fetal effects, and careful attention is focused on\\nairway management.\\nMaternal mortality relating to anesthesia has been reduced 10-fold since the 1950s, largely because\\nof an enhanced appreciation of special maternal risks associated with anesthesia. The overall\\nanesthesia-related death rate in the United States now is as low as 1.0 per million live births, a 5-fold\\ndecline in the last decade. Regional anesthesia now is more commonly performed for caesarean\\ndelivery, fewer births occur in hospitals performing fewer than 500 deliveries per year, and having\\nboth in-house anesthesia and obstetric physician coverage is more common. Historically, women have\\na higher chance of dying under general anesthesia than regional anesthesia during caesarean\\ndeliveries. During the 1970s and 1980s, the case fatality rate for general anesthesia during caesarean\\ndelivery was 32.3 per million and the rate for regional anesthesia was 1.9 per million. Thus 17 women\\ndied under general anesthesia for every 1 who died from regional anesthesia. By the 1990s, that ratio\\ndropped to 6 to 1. In the 2000s, the case fatality rate for general anesthesia during caesarean delivery\\nhas decreased to 6.5 per million and case fatality rate for regional anesthesia has slightly increased to\\n3.8. The relative risk of general compared with regional anesthesia fell to 1.7. General anesthesia now\\nseems just as safe as a spinal or epidural for caesarean delivery. The decline in deaths under general\\nanesthesia could be attributed to better anesthetic monitoring, better management of difficult airway-\\nfailed intubation, and expertise with laryngeal airway mask and other airways devices. Difficulty with\\nintubation, aspiration, and hypoxemia leading to cardiopulmonary arrest are the leading causes of\\nanesthesia-related maternal death under general anesthesia. And the leading causes of anesthesia-\\nrelated maternal death from regional anesthesia are high spinal or epidural block, respiratory failure,\\nand drug reaction.\\nAnother point of concern is that the overall maternal mortality (not related specifically to\\nanesthesia) has increased in the United States since 1985. This increase in maternal mortality is most\\npronounced in older parturients (older than 35 years), particularly in black parturients.\\nCardiomyopathy, hypertension, obesity, and hemorrhage are the principal etiologies associated with\\nthese rising mortality rates and are important factors for the anesthesiologist to consider.\\nTECHNIQUES OF ANALGESIA WITHOUT THE USE OF DRUGS\\nPsychophysical Methods'),\n",

The psychoprophylactic technique was developed by Velvovski, who\\npublished the results of his work from Russia in 1950. In Russia in the mid-1950s, it became evident\\nthat obstetric psychoprophylaxis was a useful substitute for poorly administered or dangerously\\nconducted anesthesia for labor and delivery. This method was later introduced in France by Lamaze.\\nHypnosis for pain relief has achieved periodic spurts of popularity since the early 1800s and depends\\non the power of suggestion.\\nMany obstetricians argue that psychoprophylaxis can largely eliminate the pain of childbirth by\\ndiminishing cortical appreciation of pain impulses rather than by depressing cortical function, as\\noccurs with drug-induced analgesia. Relaxation, suggestion, concentration, and motivation are factors\\nthat overlap other methods of preparation for childbirth. Some of them are closely related to hypnosis.\\nThese techniques can significantly reduce anxiety, tension, and fear. They provide the parturient\\nwith a valuable understanding of the physiologic changes that occur during labor and delivery. In\\naddition, they provide an opportunity for closer understanding and communication between the patient\\nand her mate, who may be an important source of comfort to her during the stressful process of\\nchildbirth. If psychophysical techniques do no more than this, they deserve the obstetrician’s support.\\nStudies undertaken to assess the effectiveness of psychophysical techniques have reported widely\\ndivergent results, with effectiveness ranging from as low as 10–20% to as high as 70–80%. The\\noverall benefit is best judged by the parturient herself, with validation by the observations of\\nattendants. As is no doubt true in other aspects of medical practice in which emotional overlay and\\nsubjective reporting play a role in the evaluation of specific types of therapy, the personality and level\\nof enthusiasm of the doctor can strongly influence the patient’s reactions to a given therapy.\\nPractitioners who are skeptical of psychophysical techniques cannot expect to accomplish very much\\nusing them.\\nNone of these psychophysical techniques should be forced on a patient, even by a skillful provider.\\nThe patient must not be made to feel that she will fail if she does not choose to complete her labor and\\ndelivery without analgesic medication.

Verbal suggestion and somatosensory stimulation may help\\nto alleviate discomfort associated with the first stage of labor. In addition, hypnotic states may\\nprovide apparent analgesia and amnesia for distressing, anxiety-provoking experiences. Finally,\\nhypnotic techniques may substantially improve the parturient’s outlook and behavior by reducing fear\\nand apprehension.

Route of Administration\\nSystemic techniques of analgesia and anesthesia include both oral and parenteral routes of\\nadministration. Parenteral administration includes subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous\\ninjection. Sedatives, tranquilizers, and analgesics usually are given by intramuscular injection. In\\nsome cases, the intravenous route is preferred.\\nThe advantages of intravenous administration are (1) avoidance of variable rates of uptake due to\\npoor vascular supply in fat or muscle; (2) prompt onset of effect; (3) titration of effect, avoiding the\\n“peak effect” of an intramuscular bolus; and (4) smaller effective doses because of earlier onset of\\naction.\\nThe disadvantages of intravenous injection are inadvertent arterial injection and the depressant\\neffect of over-dosage, but the advantage of smaller dosage outweighs the disadvantages.\\nAlways administer the lowest concentration and the smallest dose to obtain the desired effect.\\nB. Physical and Chemical Factors\\nAnesthetics penetrate body cells by passing through the lipid membrane boundary. This membrane is\\nnot permeable to charged (ionized) drugs but is permeable to unionized forms of drugs. Much of the\\ntotal drug transfer is dependent on the degree of lipid solubility, so local anesthetics are characterized\\nby aromatic rings that are lipophilic, and all are lipid-soluble. The intermediate amine radical of a\\nlocal anesthetic is a weak base that in aqueous solutions exists partly as undissociated free base and\\npartly as dissociated cation. \\nFigure 24–1\\n shows the equilibrium for such an existence and the\\nHenderson-Hasselbalch equation, with which the proportion of the anesthetic in the charged and\\nuncharged forms can be determined. The ratio of the cation to the base form of the drug is important,\\nbecause the base form is responsible for penetration and tissue diffusion of the local anesthetic,\\nwhereas the cation form is responsible for local analgesia when the drug contacts the site of action\\nwithin the sodium channel on the axolemma.'),\n",

Fick’s law may appear to be a simple\\nmethod of determining drug transfer, but other complexities exist: differential blood flow on either\\nside of the placenta, volume of maternal and fetal blood, and various shunts in the intervillous space\\nthat are important determinants of the final amount of drug a fetus may receive. Certain maternal\\ndisorders, such as hypertensive cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and preeclampsia-eclampsia, may\\nalter placental blood flow and in some way affect the extent of drug distribution.\\nAs the placenta matures, the thickness of the epithelial trophoblastic layer progressively decreases.\\nThis reduction may cause the thickness of the tissue layers between the maternal and fetal\\ncompartments to decrease 10-fold (from as much as 25 μm in early gestation to 2 μm at term in some\\nspecies). As gestation progresses, the surface area of the placenta also increases. At term, these\\nchanges in physical structure tend to favor improved transfer of drugs across the placenta.\\nPlacental transfer is affected by the pH of the blood on both sides of the placenta. The pH of the\\nblood on the fetal side of the placenta normally is 0.1–0.2 U lower than that on the maternal side.\\nTherefore, passage of drug to the fetal unit results in a tendency for more of the drug to exist in the\\nionized state. Because the maternal–fetal equilibrium is established only between the unionized\\nfraction of the drug on either side of the barrier, this physiologic differential will expedite maternal–\\nfetal transfer of drug. With more drug in the ionized form in the fetal unit, the new equilibrium that\\narises results in a greater total (ionized plus unionized) drug load in the fetus. Because the pK\\na\\n values\\nof commonly used local anesthetics are closer to the maternal blood pH, these agents tend to\\naccumulate on the fetal side of the placenta. This also is true of other basic drugs such as morphine,\\nmeperidine, and propranolol. Further decreases in the fetal pH lead to additional drug entrapment in\\nthe fetus. For acidic drugs (eg, thiopental) the shift in total drug concentration is in the opposite\\ndirection, that is, toward the maternal side of the placenta.\\nIn summary, the rate of transfer of a drug is governed mainly by (1) lipid solubility, (2) degree of\\ndrug ionization, (3) placental blood flow, (4) molecular weight, (5) placental metabolism, and (6)\\nprotein binding.\\nD. Fetal Distribution\\nAfter a drug deposited in the maternal compartment passes through the maternal–fetal barrier, the\\ndrug must reach the fetus and undergo distribution (\\nFig. 24–3\\n). The response of the fetus and newborn\\ndepends on drug concentration in vessel-rich organs, such as the brain, heart, and liver. Drugs\\ntransferred from the maternal to the fetal compartment of the placenta are then diluted before\\ndistribution to the various fetal vital organs. Approximately 85% of the blood in the umbilical vein,\\nwhich passes from the placenta to the fetus, passes through the fetal liver and then into the inferior\\nvena cava. The remainder bypasses the liver and enters the vena cava primarily via the ductus\\nvenosus. An admixture of blood coming from the lower extremities, the abdominal viscera, the upper\\nextremities, and the thorax further reduces the drug concentration. Blood from the right atrium shunts\\nfrom right to left through the foramen ovale into the left atrium, resulting in a final concentration on\\nthe left side of the heart that is only slightly lower than that in the vena cava.'),\n",

Drug is passed from the maternal compartment, via the placenta (a partial barrier), to\\nthe fetal compartment, where the principles of drug dynamics (ie, distribution, biotransformation, and\\nexcretion) determine the eventual specific organ tissue levels. One purely mechanical barrier exists\\nbetween the maternal and fetal compartments, which attains importance in the late first and second\\nstages of labor—the umbilical cord, which is susceptible to partial and total occlusion.\\nThe amount of drug ultimately reaching a vital organ is related to that organ’s blood supply.\\nBecause the central nervous system is the most highly vascularized fetal organ, it receives the greatest\\namount of drug. Once the drug reaches the fetal liver, it may either be bound to protein or\\nmetabolized.\\nThe uptake of drug by fetal tissues can be very rapid after either intravenous or epidural\\nadministration. Measurable concentrations of local anesthetics have been found in fetal tissues as\\nearly as 1–2 minutes after injection. Lipid solubility of a drug is important in developing\\nconcentrations in certain organs with high lipid content, such as the adrenal, ovary, liver, and brain.\\nDrug metabolism and excretion are the final features of the fetal distribution picture. The fetal liver\\nis able to metabolize drugs and numerous substrates as early as the second trimester, an ability that\\nimproves to term. Narcotics and sedatives are metabolized much more slowly by the fetal liver,\\nproducing a prolonged effect of these drugs in the newborn who is exposed in utero. Finally, the\\nability of the fetus to excrete drugs is also reduced by reduced renal function.\\nSystemic Analgesics & Anesthetics\\nA. Sedatives (Hypnotics\\n)\\nThe principal use of sedative–hypnotic drugs is to produce drowsiness. For many years, these drugs\\nwere the only ones available to reduce anxiety and induce drowsiness. The latent phase of the first\\nstage of labor can be managed by either psychologic support alone or utilization of sedative–hypnotic\\ncompounds. Psychologic support may be complemented by the use of sedatives. When properly used,\\nthese drugs induce tranquility and an enhanced feeling of well-being. They are poor analgesics and do\\nnot raise the pain threshold appreciably in conscious subjects. Amnesia does not occur. Labor may be\\nslowed by large doses of sedatives, especially when given too early in the first stage.\\nThe use of barbiturates alone for obstetric analgesia is not common practice and should be\\ndiscouraged. The required dosage is dangerous to the fetus, which is extremely sensitive to central\\nnervous system depression by these drugs. Periodic apnea and even abolition of all movements outlast\\nthe effects of the barbiturates on the mother.\\nB. Tranquilizers & Amnestics\\nThese drugs are used principally to relieve apprehension and anxiety and to produce a calm state.\\nAdditionally, they may potentiate the effects of other sedatives. An analgesic-potentiating effect is\\noften claimed for this group of agents but has not been definitely demonstrated. Hydroxyzine and\\ndiazepam are popular tranquilizer–amnestics. Scopolamine, which was widely popular in obstetrics in\\nthe past, produces no analgesia but has a mild sedative and marked amnestic effect. Scopolamine is no\\nlonger used because the amnesia produced is excessive and prolonged. Diazepam should be avoided\\nduring labor because it has a long chemical half-life, which is even more prolonged in the neonate.\\nDiazepam readily crosses the placenta and is found in significant concentrations in fetal plasma. At\\npresent, diazepam is not recommended if the neonate is premature because of the threat of kernicterus.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Other potential side effects related to the use of diazepam are fetal hypotonia, hypothermia, and a loss\\nof beat-to-beat variability in the fetal heart rate.\\nOne of the controversies over diazepam concerns the content of sodium benzoate and benzoic acid\\nbuffers. Both compounds are potent uncouplers of the bilirubin–albumin complex, and some\\ninvestigators have suggested that the neonate may be more susceptible to kernicterus because of an\\nincrease level of free circulating bilirubin. However, because injectable diazepam is effective in the\\ntreatment of human newborn seizure disorders, opiate withdrawal, and tetanus and because it is\\nregarded as a useful adjunct in obstetric analgesia, a study was undertaken in animals in which\\ncomparable quantities of sodium benzoate were injected to determine whether significant amounts of\\nbilirubin would be made available to the circulation. Midazolam, a short-acting water-soluble\\nbenzodiazepine, appears to be devoid of the neonatal effects seen with diazepam and is more rapidly\\ncleared. In small doses it could conceivably become a useful anxiolytic for the laboring patient.\\nMidazolam is 3–4 times more potent than diazepam, and there is a brief delay in the onset of its\\nsedative effect after intravenous injection. Doses should be kept below 0.075 mg/kg to avoid excessive\\nanterograde amnesia.\\nC. Narcotic Analgesics\\nSystemic analgesic drugs (including narcotics) are commonly used in the first stage of labor because\\nthey produce both a state of analgesia and mood elevation. The favored drugs are codeine 60 mg\\nintramuscularly or meperidine 50–100 mg intramuscularly or 25–50 mg (titrated) intravenously. The\\ncombination of morphine and scopolamine was once popular for its “twilight sleep” effect but is\\nrarely used now. Common undesirable effects of this combination of drugs are nausea and vomiting,\\ncough suppression, intestinal stasis, and diminution in frequency, intensity, and duration of uterine\\ncontractions in the early first stage of labor. Also, amnesia is excessive for these patients.\\nMorphine is not used in active laboring patients because of the excessive respiratory depression\\nseen in the neonate compared with equipotent doses of other narcotics. Fetuses who are of young\\ngestational age, are small for dates, or have undergone trauma or long labor are more susceptible to\\nnarcosis.\\nFentanyl is a popular synthetic narcotic that has been used in obstetrics in both the systemic and\\nepidural compartments. Its use in the epidural compartment has met with good success when\\ncombined with small quantities and low concentrations of bupivacaine. Data supporting its use come\\nfrom both Europe and the United States.\\nSufentanil is a derivative of fentanyl with increased potency and lipophilicity. It is widely used for\\nintrathecal and epidural analgesia during labor. Potential adverse effects of sufentanil include possible\\nplacental deposition and neonatal respiratory depression. Adding intrathecal or epidural sufentanil to\\nbupivacaine improves labor analgesia with faster onset and longer duration compared with\\nbupivacaine alone. The usual dose is 3–5 μg intrathecally and 10–15 μg epidurally.\\nRemifentanil is a newer ultra short-acting synthetic opioid with rapid onset (approximately 1\\nminute) after intravenous administration. It is rapidly metabolized by nonspecific blood and tissue\\nesterases, not depending on renal or hepatic function, and hence it does not accumulate in the fetus.\\nThis rapid onset and elimination facilitate its effective and safe use during labor. Remifentanil has\\nbeen administered as intravenous analgesia for labor using a variety of methods, including baseline\\ninfusion, PCA boluses (with or without baseline infusion), and target-controlled infusions.\\nButorphanol (Stadol) is a synthetic parenteral analgesic that has agonist and antagonist of opioid\\nproperties. It is 5 times as potent as morphine and 40 times as potent as meperidine. The typical doses\\nare 1–2 mg intravenously or intramuscularly every 3–4 hours. Onset of analgesia is within a few'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='minutes after intravenous injection. There is less respiratory depression compared with an equivalent\\ndose of morphine due to ceiling effect from its agonist-antagonist properties. This property makes\\nbutorphanol particularly useful for labor analgesia, when respiratory depression of the fetus/neonate is\\na concern.\\nNalbuphine (Nubain) is a mixed agonist/antagonist opioid similar to butorphanol commonly used\\nfor parenteral labor analgesia. Its potency is equivalent to that of morphine on a milligram basis. The\\nonset of action after intravenous injection is 2–3 minutes with duration of 5–6 hours. The usual dose is\\n10–20 mg intravenously every 4–6 hours. It is metabolized predominantly by the liver and excreted by\\nthe kidney.\\nD. Thiobarbiturate\\nIntravenous anesthetics such as thiopental and thiamylal are widely used in general surgery. However,\\nless than 4 minutes after a thiobarbiturate is injected into the \\nmother’s vein, the concentrations of the\\ndrug in the fetal and maternal blood will be equal. The mother will lose consciousness and airway\\nprotective reflexes with a thiopental dose of 1.5–2 mg/kg; therefore, it should be used only in\\nassociation with general endotracheal anesthesia. Thiopental doses of 3–4 mg/kg are used for\\ninduction of general anesthesia.\\nE. Propofol\\nPropofol is a newer induction agent that was introduced into practice in the United States in the early\\n1990s. As an induction agent, it is similar to the barbiturates in mild cardiac depression and loss of\\nperipheral vasomotor tone. It offers the advantages of rapid clearance, short duration of action,\\nantiemetic properties, and reduced risk of airway reactivity. It is an ideal agent for induction of\\ngeneral anesthesia at a dose of 2 mg/kg in parturients. It also can be used in 10- to 20-mg increments\\nduring surgery under regional block to treat nausea and vomiting. Neonatal Apgar scores and\\numbilical gases are similar after induction with propofol or barbiturates.\\nF. Etomidate\\nEtomidate is an intravenous induction agent that has been used in obstetric anesthesia since 1979. It\\nproduces a rapid onset of anesthesia with minimal cardiorespiratory effects. This property makes it\\nideal for parturients who are hemodynamically unstable or who would not tolerate hemodynamic\\naberrations well. With an induction dose of 0.2–0.3 mg/kg, etomidate undergoes a rapid hydrolysis\\nthat leads to quick recovery. Etomidate crosses the placenta rapidly; however, large variations in the\\nUV/MV (umbilical vein: maternal vein) ratio (0.04–0.5) have been reported. Etomidate may cause\\npain at the injection site and involuntary muscle movements in some patients.\\nG. Ketamine\\nThe phencyclidine derivative ketamine produces anesthesia by a dissociative interruption of afferent\\npathways from cortical perception. It has become a useful and widely used adjunctive agent in\\nobstetrics because maternal cardiovascular status and uterine blood flow are well maintained.\\nEffective maternal analgesia results from low doses of 0.25–0.5 mg/kg but without loss of\\nconsciousness or protective reflexes. The margin of safety is narrow, however, so it should be used\\nonly by physicians able to easily secure and protect the airway if loss of consciousness occurs. For\\ncaesarean delivery, general anesthetic induction can be produced with 1–2 mg/kg intravenously.\\nKetamine stimulates the cardiovascular system to maintain heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac\\noutput. It is useful in the setting of major blood loss, when rapid induction of general anesthesia is\\nrequired. However, it has significant hallucinogenic effects that limit its utility in obstetrics.'),\n",

In the past, inhaled\\nanesthetics were given during labor in subanesthetic concentrations to treat contraction pain, but they\\nare no longer used for this indication. The mask administration of these gases to the conscious\\nlaboring patient can result in airway obstruction, aspiration, and hypoxia. Also, the vaporized gases\\nwould unacceptably contaminate the labor room environment because effectively scavenging of\\nexhaust gases from the room is not possible. Finally, of all the presently used volatile anesthetics,\\nonly nitrous oxide has analgesic properties at subanesthetic concentrations.\\nThe most commonly used inhaled anesthetics in pregnancy are nitrous oxide, sevoflurane,\\ndesflurane, and isoflurane. These drugs all readily cross the placenta and produce significant blood\\nconcentrations in the fetus. During the brief exposure to maternally administered anesthetic gases, the\\nfetus is not adversely affected. Fetal cardiac output is slightly reduced by these drugs, but critical\\norgan blood flow is unaffected, and fetal acid–base status is unchanged. Exposure to minimum\\nalveolar concentrations of anesthetic gases for more than 15 minutes is associated with reduced Apgar\\nscores, but other parameters of fetal and newborn well-being are unimpaired.\\nThe term parturient is more sensitive to the anesthetic effects of all inhaled anesthetics,\\npresumably as a result of elevated progesterone levels. This increased sensitivity of 20–30%\\ncompared with nonpregnant subjects places the patient at increased risk for obtundation and\\naspiration; therefore, these drugs should not be administered without preparation for endotracheal\\nintubation. Volatile agents except N\\n2\\nO produce uterine relaxation, and high concentrations should be\\navoided during delivery to prevent uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage. At low concentrations\\n(<1%), they produce amnesia, and their tocolytic effects are easily counteracted by standard infusions\\nof oxytocin (Pitocin).\\nREGIONAL ANESTHESIA\\nRegional anesthesia is achieved by injection of a local anesthetic (\\nTable 24–2\\n) around the nerves that\\npass from spinal segments to the peripheral nerves responsible for sensory innervation of a portion of\\nthe body. More recently, narcotics have been added to local anesthetics to improve analgesia and\\nreduce some side effects of local anesthetics. Regional nerve blocks used in obstetrics include the\\nfollowing: (1) lumbar epidural and caudal epidural block, (2) subarachnoid (spinal) block, (3)\\ncombined spinal epidural block, and (4) pudendal block.\\nTable 24–2\\n.

Major conductive\\nanesthesia and general anesthesia in obstetrics require specialized knowledge and expertise in\\nconjunction with close maternal and fetal monitoring. This field of expertise has developed as a\\nsubspecialty within anesthesia, reflecting the need for specialized understanding of the obstetric\\npatient and her response and of the fetal responses to anesthesia.\\nPatient Selection\\nRegional anesthesia is appropriate for labor analgesia, caesarean delivery, and other obstetric\\noperative procedures (eg, postpartum tubal ligation, cervical cerclage). Most patients prefer to remain\\nawake; however, occasionally a choice is made to provide general anesthesia.\\nThe anesthesiologist will assess the patient to determine the relative risks of general versus\\nregional anesthesia. For example, some forms of valvular heart disease may contraindicate regional\\nblock, and general anesthesia may be considered more appropriate. Other contraindications to regional\\nanesthesia include infection, coagulopathy, hypovolemia, progressive neurologic disease, and patient\\nrefusal.\\nPatient Preparation\\nThe woman who is well informed and has a good rapport with her physician generally is a calm and\\ncooperative candidate for regional or general anesthesia. The patient and her partner should be well\\ninformed early in her pregnancy of the options for labor anesthesia as well as for caesarean section if\\nthat circumstance arises. The anesthesiologist can be involved early in pregnancy if the patient has\\nspecial concerns about anesthesia (family history of anesthetic risk, previous back surgery,\\ncoagulation problems). Some hospitals have obstetric anesthesia preassessment clinics that deal with\\nthese patient concerns.\\nLocal Anesthetic Agents\\nA local anesthetic drug blocks the action potential of nerves when their axons are exposed to the\\nmedication. Local anesthetic agents act by modifying the ionic permeability of the cell membrane to\\nstabilize its resting potential. The smaller the nerve fiber, the more sensitive it is to local anesthetics\\nbecause the susceptibility of individual nerve fibers is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional\\ndiameter of the fibers. Hence, with regional anesthesia, the patient’s \\nperception of light touch, pain,\\nand temperature and her capacity for vasomotor control are obtunded sooner and with a smaller\\nconcentration of the drug than is the perception of pressure or the function of motor nerves to striated\\nmuscles. The exception to this rule is the sensitivity of autonomic nerve fibers that are blocked by the\\nlowest concentration of local anesthetic despite their being larger than some sensory nerves.\\nOnly anesthetic drugs that are completely reversible and nonirritating and cause minimal toxicity\\nare clinically acceptable. Other desirable properties of regional anesthetic agents include rapidity of\\nonset, predictability of duration, and ease of sterilization. \\nTable 24–2\\n summarizes the local anesthetics\\ncommonly used in obstetrics and gynecology together with their uses and doses.\\nAll local anesthetics have certain undesirable dose-related side effects when absorbed systemically.\\nAll these drugs are capable of stimulating the central nervous system and may cause bradycardia,\\nhypertension, or respiratory stimulation at the medullary level.

This response stimulates grand mal\\nseizures because it is followed by depression, loss of vasomotor control, hypotension, respiratory\\ndepression, and coma. Such an episode of indirect cardiovascular depression often is accentuated by a\\ndirect vasodilatory and myocardial depressant effect. The latter is comparable to the action of\\nquinidine. This effect explains why lidocaine is useful for treatment of certain cardiac arrhythmias.\\nChloroprocaine is an ester derivative that was popular in 1970s primarily because of its rapid onset\\nand short duration of action and its low toxicity to the fetus. It is metabolized by plasma\\ncholinesterase and therefore does not demand liver enzyme degradation, as do the more complex and\\nlonger acting amide derivatives. Chloroprocaine has a half-life of 21 seconds in adult blood and 43\\nseconds in neonatal blood. Direct toxic effects on the fetus are minimized because fewer drugs are\\navailable for transfer in the maternal compartment.\\nThe potency of chloroprocaine is comparable to that of lidocaine and mepivacaine, and the drug is\\n3 times more potent than procaine. Its average onset of action ranges from 6–12 minutes and persists\\nfor 30–60 minutes, depending on the amount used. Chloroprocaine is often used for urgent caesarean\\ndelivery when epidural catheter is already placed to avoid general anesthesia.\\nBupivacaine, the amide local anesthetic, is related to lido-caine and mepivacaine but has some very\\ndifferent physico-chemical properties. It has a much higher lipid solubility, a higher degree of binding\\nto maternal plasma protein, and a much longer duration of action. More than with other local\\nanesthetics, the concentration of bupivacaine can be reduced to produce sensory block with minimal\\nmotor block. Because injection of bupivacaine for labor pain relief now is mostly in the form of\\ncontinuous small-volume and minimal concentration administration via a pump mechanism, the\\ncomplications previously of concern, such as hypotension and convulsions, are now rare.\\nA word of caution is needed regarding the administration of bupivacaine for caesarean delivery.\\nThis drug has been implicated in certain cardiovascular catastrophes associated with initial drug\\ninjection, such as cardiac arrests that were refractory to full and appropriate resuscitative attempts.\\nAlthough these catastrophes are rare, the practitioner is well advised to inject no more than 5 mL of\\nthe drug at any one time, to wait 4–5 minutes, then to repeat the procedure until the desired volume\\nhas been delivered. The maximum concentration of bupivacaine now allowed by the Food and Drug\\nAdministration (FDA) for obstetric epidural anesthesia is 0.5%. The dose of more than 3 mg/kg is\\nconsidered a toxic dose now. The safety of bupivacaine can be enhanced by giving it in fractional\\ndoses (eg, 5 mL every 5 minutes).\\nRopivacaine is a newer amide local anesthetic introduced into the United States in the mid-1990s.\\nIt is less lipid-soluble than bupivacaine, and initial studies suggested that it produced less motor\\nblockade and was less cardiotoxic than its homologue bupivacaine. Later studies have been less\\nconvincing in documenting improved efficacy and safety, but ropivacaine has replaced bupivacaine in\\nsome institutions. There is ongoing study of the safety and efficacy of levobupivacaine, the\\nlevorotatory isomer of bupivacaine, which may also prove less cardiotoxic than its racemic parent\\nmolecule. Both of these newer amide local anesthetics are used in doses and concentrations similar to\\nthose of bupivacaine.\\nLocal Infiltration Analgesia\\nLocal tissue infiltration of dilute solutions of anesthetic drugs generally yields satisfactory results\\nbecause the target is the fine nerve fibers. Nevertheless, one must keep in mind the dangers of\\nsystemic toxicity when large areas are anesthetized or when reinjection is required.

Either bolus injections or continuous\\ninfusion of local anesthetics is used for labor, vaginal delivery, or caesarean surgery. Narcotics are\\nadded to supplement the quality of the block.\\nAfter the patient is evaluated, an epidural block can be placed once labor is established. Drug\\ndosages can be \\nadjusted as circumstances change. The catheter can be used for surgery and\\npostoperative analgesia if necessary. The second stage of labor is prolonged by epidural anesthesia;\\nhowever, the duration of the first stage is unaffected. The use of outlet forceps is increased, but fetal\\noutcome is not adversely affected by epidural block.\\nThe epidural block technique must be exact, and inadvertent massive (high) spinal anesthesia\\noccasionally occurs. Other undesirable reactions include the rapid absorption syndrome (hypotension,\\nbradycardia, hallucinations, and convulsions), postpartum backache, and paresthesias. Epidural block\\nshould eradicate pain between T10 and L1 for the first stage of labor and between T10 and S5 for the\\nsecond stage of labor.\\nThe procedure is as follows. Inject 3 mL of a 1.5% aqueous solution of lidocaine or similar agent\\ninto the catheter as a test dose. If spinal anesthesia does not result after 5–10 minutes, inject an\\nadditional 5 mL. Inject 10 mL of the anesthetic solution in total to slowly accomplish an adequate\\ndegree and suitable level of anesthesia. Once the block is established, a continuous infusion of 10–12\\nmL/h will maintain the block for labor. Bupivacaine 0.125–0.25% is most often used for an epidural\\nblock, with fentanyl 2–5 μg/mL in the epidural mixture.\\nThe mother is nursed in a wedged or lateral position to prevent aortocaval compression. The\\nsympathectomy produced by the block predisposes the patient to venous pooling and reduced venous\\nreturn. Maternal blood pressure must be measured frequently when the epidural is in effect.\\nB. Caudal Block\\nCaudal anesthesia (\\nFig. 24–4\\n) is an epidural block approached through the caudal space. It can provide\\nselective sacral block for the second stage of labor; however, it is rarely used now because of\\ncomplications specific to the obstetric patient. The descent of the fetal head against the perineum, in\\naddition to the sacral edema at term, obscures the landmarks of the sacral hiatus. This makes the\\ncaudal procedure technically challenging, and reports of transfixing the rectum and fetal skull\\npuncture with the epidural needle have led many anesthesiologists to avoid this technique.

Spinal Anesthesia\\nSpinal anesthesia currently is the anesthetic of choice for caesarean delivery. Spinal anesthesia can be\\nperformed \\nmore quickly than epidural anesthesia and provides ideal operating conditions, including\\ndense sensory and motor block. The onset of sympathectomy is more abrupt than with epidural block,\\nso care must be taken to ensure that the patient is adequately preloaded with 1.5–2 L of saline solution\\nbefore performing the technique. Spinal anesthesia is used less commonly these days to alleviate the\\npain of delivery and the third stage of labor. The advantages of spinal anesthesia are that the mother\\nremains conscious to witness delivery, no inhalation anesthetics or analgesic drugs are required, the\\ntechnique is not difficult, and good relaxation of the pelvic floor and lower birth canal is achieved.\\nPrompt anesthesia is achieved within 5–10 minutes. The dosage of spinal anesthetic is small.\\nComplications are rare and easy to treat. However, spinal headache occurs in 1–2% of patients.\\nD. Combined Spinal–Epidural Analgesia\\nThe use of combined spinal–epidural anesthesia (CSE) became popular in the mid 1990s as an\\nalternative to epidural anesthesia for labor. A small dose of local anesthetic and narcotic (2.5 mg\\nbupivacaine and 25 μg fentanyl) is injected through a spinal needle, which is introduced through the\\nepidural needle and advanced into the intrathecal space. The spinal needle is withdrawn and the\\nepidural catheter placed for later use. The spinal medication produces immediate pain relief and\\nminimal motor block and may allow ambulation. Later in labor, the epidural catheter is used for\\ncontinuous infusion of epidural solution, similar to that described for standard epidural anesthesia in\\nlabor.\\nDetractors of CSE argue that the technique may increase the incidence of post–lumbar puncture\\nheadache and that ambulation even after low-dose spinal injection is unsafe for both mother and baby.\\nFinally, because the technique is technically cumbersome, it may be associated with higher\\ncomplication rates, although the studies did not support this statement.\\nThe most serious consequence of spinal or epidural anesthesia is maternal mortality. Maternal'),\n",

These deaths were\\nattributed to venous uptake of the drug and immediate and lasting myocardial depression from the\\nlocal anesthetic, which did not respond to appropriate cardiac resuscitative efforts. Today maternal\\nmortality associated with regional anesthesia is lower, primarily because bolus dosing of high\\nconcentrations of local anesthesia is no longer performed.\\nMost side effects of spinal or epidural anesthesia are secondary to block of the sympathetic nerve\\nfibers that accompany the anterior roots of the spinal thoracic and upper lumbar nerves\\n(thoracolumbar outflow). Thus many physiologic regulating mechanisms are disturbed. The blood\\npressure falls as a result of loss of arterial resistance and venous pooling—assuming no compensation\\nis made by change of the patient’s position (eg, Trendelenburg position). If high thoracic dermatomes\\n(T1–T5) are blocked, alteration of the cardiac sympathetic innervation slows the heart rate and\\nreduces cardiac contractility. Epinephrine secretion by the adrenal medulla is depressed.\\nConcomitantly, the unopposed parasympathetic effect of cardiac slowing alters vagal stimulations. As\\na result of these and related changes, shock follows promptly, especially in hypotensive or\\nhypovolemic patients. Moreover, a precipitous fall in the blood pressure of the arteriosclerotic\\nhypertensive patient is inevitable.\\nFluids, oxygen therapy for adequate tissue perfusion, shock position to encourage venous return,\\nand pressor drugs given intravenously are recommended.\\nIn the past, postdural puncture headache (PDPH) due to leakage of cerebrospinal fluid through the\\nneedle hole in the dura was an early postoperative complication in up to 15% of patients. Small-\\ncaliber needles (25F) decrease the incidence of headache to 8–10%. With the introduction of pencil-\\npoint Whitaker and Sprotte spinal needles, the incidence of PDPH has been reduced to 1–2%. Therapy\\nfor PDPH includes recumbent position, hydration, sedation, and, in severe cases, epidural injection of\\n10–20 mL of the patient’s fresh blood to “seal” the defect.\\nRarely, spinal or epidural anesthesia caused nerve injury and transient or permanent hypesthesia or\\nparesthesia. Excessive drug concentration, sensitivity, or infection may have been responsible for\\nsome of these complications. The incidence of serious complications of spinal or epidural anesthesia\\nis considerably lower than that of cardiac arrest during general anesthesia.\\nE. Paracervical Block\\nParacervical block is no longer considered a safe technique for the obstetric patient. In the past,\\nparacervical anesthesia was used to relieve the pain of the first stage of labor. Pudendal block was\\nrequired for pain during the second stage of labor. Sensory nerve fibers from the uterus fuse\\nbilaterally at the 4–6 o’clock and 6–8 o’clock positions around the cervix in the region of the cervical–\\nvaginal junction. Ordinarily, when 5–10 mL of 1% lidocaine or its equivalent is injected into these\\nareas, interruption of the sensory input from the cervix and uterus promptly follows.\\nMany now consider paracervical block to be contraindicated in obstetrics because of the potential\\nadverse fetal effects. Many reports in the literature place the incidence of fetal bradycardia at 8–18%.\\nHowever, recent work with accurate fetal heart rate monitoring associated with continuous uterine\\ncontraction patterns suggests that the incidence is closer to 20–25%. Some researchers have attempted\\nto investigate the significance of the bradycardia. One explanation is that an acid–base disturbance in\\nthe fetus does not occur unless the bradycardia lasts longer than 10 minutes and that neonatal\\ndepression is rare unless associated with delivery during the period of bradycardia. There seems to be\\nlittle difference in the incidence and severity of fetal bradycardia by paracervical block between\\ncomplicated and \\nuncomplicated patients. Other disadvantages of paracervical block include maternal'),\n",

Pudendal Nerve Block\\nPudendal block has been one of the most popular of all nerve block techniques in obstetrics. The\\ninfant is not depressed, and blood loss is minimal. The technique is simplified by the fact that the\\npudendal nerve approaches the spine of the ischium on its course to innervate the perineum. Injection\\nof 10 mL of 1% lidocaine on each side will achieve analgesia for 30–45 minutes approximately 50%\\nof the time.\\nBoth the transvaginal and transcutaneous methods are useful for administering a pudendal block.\\nThe transvaginal technique has important practical advantages over the trans-cutaneous technique.\\nThe “Iowa trumpet” needle guide can be used, and the operator’s finger should be placed at the end of\\nthe needle guide to palpate the sacrospinous ligament, which runs in the same direction and is just\\nanterior to the pudendal nerve and artery. Appreciating the sensation of the needle puncturing the\\nligament usually is difficult. This facet of the technique (no definite end point) may make it difficult\\nfor the inexperienced clinician to perform. Aspiration of the syringe for possible inadvertent entry into\\nthe pudendal artery should be accomplished, and, if no blood is returned, 10 mL of local anesthetic\\nsolution should be injected in a fanlike fashion on the right and left sides. The successful performance\\nof the pudendal block requires injection of the drug at least 10–12 minutes before episiotomy. Often in\\nclinical practice, pudendal block is performed within 4–5 minutes of episiotomy, so the local\\nanesthetic may not have adequate time to take effect.\\n1. Advantages and disadvantages\\n—Advantages of pudendal nerve block are its safety, ease of\\nadministration, and rapidity of onset of effect. Disadvantages include maternal trauma, bleeding, and\\ninfection; rare maternal convulsions due to drug sensitivity; occasional complete or partial failure;\\nand regional discomfort during administration.\\nThe pudendal perineal block, like any other nerve block, demands some technical experience and\\nknowledge of the innervation of the lower birth canal. Nevertheless, in spite of a well-placed bilateral\\nblock, skip areas of perineal analgesia may be noted. The possible reason is that although the pudendal\\nnerve of S2–S4 derivation does contribute to the majority of fibers for sensory innervation to the\\nperineum, other sensory fibers also are involved. For example, the inferior hemorrhoidal nerve may\\nhave an origin independent from that of the sacral nerve and therefore will not be a component branch\\nof the pudendal nerve. In this case, it must be infiltrated separately. In addition, the posterior femoral\\ncutaneous nerve (S1–S3) origin may contribute an important perineal branch to the anterior fourchette\\nbilaterally. In instances in which this nerve plays a major role in innervation, it must be blocked\\nseparately by local skin infiltration.\\nTwo other nerves contribute to the sensory innervation of the perineum: the ilioinguinal nerve, of\\nL1 origin, and the genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve, of L1 and L2 origin. Both of these nerves\\nsweep superficially over the mons pubis to innervate the skin over the symphysis of the mons pubis\\nand the labium majus. Occasionally, these nerves must also be separately infiltrated to provide\\noptimal perineal analgesic effect. Thus it should be apparent that a simple bilateral pudendal nerve\\nblock may not be effective in many cases. For maximum analgesic effectiveness, in addition to a\\nbilateral pudendal block, superficial infiltration of the skin from the symphysis medially to a point\\nhalfway between the ischial spines may be necessary. Thus a true perineal block may be regarded as a\\nregional technique.\\nEither lumbar epidural or caudal epidural block should eradicate pain between the T10 and S5'),\n",

A\\nsummary of anesthetic approaches in labor is shown in \\nFigure 24–6\\n.\\nFigure 24–6\\n. First-stage management in a primipara can be divided into 3 phases. Phase I (early\\nlabor) should be managed by simple reassurance and verbal commentary if the patient has received\\nadequate antepartum education. An epidural may be performed once labor is well established. Phase II\\ncan be handled by a segmental epidural block, continued reassurance, a sedative–hypnotic drug, a\\nnarcotic, or a tranquilizer. Phase III, the accentuated phase of labor, can be handled by segmental\\nepidural block, a combination tranquilizer and analgesic, or a caudal epidural block. However, use of\\nreassurance and verbal commentary in conjunction with prepared childbirth methods may be adequate\\nfor some patients to tolerate the discomfort of phase III labor.\\nPrevention & Treatment of Local Anesthetic Overdosage\\nThe correct dose of any local anesthetic is the smallest quantity of drug in the greatest dilution that\\nwill provide adequate \\nanalgesia. The pregnant patient is more likely to have an intravascular drug\\ninjection because of venous distention in the epidural space and may be more susceptible to the toxic\\neffects of local anesthetics (\\nTable 24–3\\n). Injection of the drug into a highly vascularized area will\\nresult in more rapid systemic absorption than, for example, injection into the skin. To prevent too-\\nrapid absorption, the operator can add epinephrine to produce local vasoconstriction and prolong the\\nanesthetic. A final concentration of 1:200,000 is desirable, especially when a toxic amount is\\napproached. Epinephrine is contraindicated in patients with increased cardiac irritability of medical or\\ndrug origin.\\nTable 24–3\\n. Toxic doses of local anesthetics commonly used in obstetrics.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Treatment of local anesthetic overdosage manifested by central nervous system toxicity (a\\nconvulsion) is generally achieved effectively and without incident. However, the clinician must be\\naware of certain basic principles. These include the recognition of prodromal signs of a central\\nnervous system toxic reaction and immediate treatment as required. A toxic central nervous system\\nreaction to local anesthetics consists of ringing in the ears, diplopia, perioral numbness, and deep,\\nslurred speech. An adequate airway must be maintained, and the patient should receive 100% oxygen,\\nwith respiratory assistance if necessary. Protection of \\nthe patient’s airway and immediate injection of\\nthiopental 50 mg or midazolam 1–2 mg usually stop the convulsion immediately. Succinylcholine was\\nrecommended in the past, but it is a potent neuromuscular relaxant that requires placement of an\\nendotracheal tube with positive-pressure ventilation. Studies have indicated that cellular metabolism\\nis greatly increased during convulsive episodes so that a definite increase in cellular oxygenation\\noccurs—hence the use of a depressant selective for the hypothalamus and thalamus because these sites\\nare the foci of irritation.\\nLocal anesthetics-induced cardiotoxicity, especially by bupivacaine, is serious consequence when\\nlocal anesthetic overdosage happens. The treatment of this complication is usually difficult, and the\\npatient may suffer from arrhythmias (ventricular tachycardia) to even cardiac arrest. Intralipid\\nintravenous infusion is recommended for bupivacaine-induced cardiotoxicity. Current guidelines\\nsuggest that 20% lipid emulsion initially be administered as a bolus of 1.5 mL/kg over 1 minute. After\\ncompletion of the bolus, a continuous infusion of 0.25 mL/kg/min should be started. If the patient\\ndoes not respond to the initial bolus, 1 to 2 additional boluses may be administered. The rate of the\\ninfusion may be increased to 0.5 mL/kg if there is persistent hypotension. The infusion should be\\ncontinued until 10 min after the patient regains hemodynamic stability. An upper limit of 10 mL/kg is\\nthe recommended upper limit for administration in 30 minutes. Any patient that has had local\\nanesthetic toxicity should be monitored for 12 hours after the event, as recurrence of cardiovascular\\ninstability has been shown to occur even after lipid administration.\\nANESTHESIA FOR CAESAREAN DELIVERY\\nWith few exceptions, all caesarean deliveries in the United States are performed with spinal, epidural,\\nor general anesthesia. Maternal and neonatal outcomes are good when these techniques are performed\\neffectively. In 1982, more than half of the caesarean births in the United States were performed under\\ngeneral anesthesia. By 1998, the rate had dropped to less than 10% of all caesarean births. Spinal\\nanesthesia has become more common than epidural anesthesia for caesarean delivery in the past few'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='years, primarily as a result of the introduction of newer spinal needles that prevent post–lumbar\\npuncture headaches. Although the majority of anesthesia-related maternal mortality is associated with\\ncaesarean birth, the rate has continued to decline dramatically over the last few decades and now is\\nless than 1.5 anesthesia-related deaths per million live births in the United States.\\nRegional Analgesia\\nA. Lumbar Epidural Block\\nLumbar epidural blockade can be used for caesarean analgesia and adequate analgesia for operative\\ndelivery. As mentioned in the discussion of regional anesthesia, the major hazard of the regional\\nanalgesic technique is blockade of sympathetic fibers and a decrease in vascular resistance, along with\\nvenous pooling and hypotension. However, this can be greatly alleviated by elevating the patient’s\\nright hip to prevent compression of the vena cava by the gravid uterus when the patient is lying on the\\noperating table. In addition, the anesthesiologist can rotate the operating table 15–20 degrees to the\\nleft to rotate the uterus away from the vena cava.\\nAn epidural catheter can be placed immediately before surgery, or a catheter used to provide pain\\nrelief for labor can be reinjected for the surgery. After the catheter is suitably placed and taped in\\nposition, the patient should be rotated slightly out of the supine position to remove the hazard of vena\\ncava occlusion when local anesthetic is injected as a test dose. Lidocaine 2% with epinephrine\\n1:200,000 can be used, or lidocaine 2% without epinephrine can be used if cardiovascular instability is\\npresent. Bupivacaine 0.5% or mepivacaine 1.5% with or without epinephrine (as described for\\nlidocaine) also can be used. The total dosage for the therapeutic test is approximately 3 mL, which is\\nan adequate amount to ascertain whether or not inadvertent subarachnoid injection of the drug has\\noccurred. Incremental injections of 5 mL are then titrated to produce a T4–T6 sensory level. Usually a\\ntotal volume of 18–20 mL of local anesthetic is required.\\nThe blood pressure is monitored every 5 minutes and the dermatome levels examined every 5\\nminutes for the first 20 minutes to ascertain the height and density of the analgesic block. Usually a\\nwaiting period of only 15–20 minutes is needed for adequate analgesic block for incision. During this\\ntime, the patient’s abdomen is surgically scrubbed and prepared and the patient draped for caesarean\\ndelivery. If a brief episode of hypotension occurs, the patient is given a rapid infusion of lactated\\nRinger’s solution. In addition, the uterus must be shifted away from the vena cava. If these measures\\nare not sufficient to relieve a brief episode of hypotension, 5–10 mg of ephedrine or 50–100 μg of\\nphenylephrine can be administered intravenously for a mild vasopressor effect.\\nB. Subarachnoid Block\\nSpinal block is now the most common anesthesia used for elective caesarean delivery in the United\\nStates. The advantages are immediate onset of analgesia, so no waiting period is needed for the block\\nto become effective, and the absence of drug transmission from the maternal to the fetal compartment\\nbecause the anesthetic is deposited in the subarachnoid space in such small quantities. In addition,\\nsubarachnoid block may be a simpler technique to perform because the end point is definite—the\\nidentification of fluid from the subarachnoid space. The disadvantages are a more profound and rapid\\nonset of hypotension and more frequent nausea and vomiting due either to unopposed parasympathetic\\nstimulation of the gastrointestinal tract or to hypotension. Subarachnoid block usually is achieved via\\nthe paramedian or midline technique, details of which are beyond the scope \\nof this text. The agents\\nmost commonly used for subarachnoid analgesia are lidocaine 5% (50–75 mg) and bupivacaine 10–\\n12.5 mg. As with the lumbar epidural technique, the patient is prehydrated with 500–1000 mL of'),\n",

If hypotension occurs, the uterus should be\\npushed farther to the left to improve return of blood from the lower extremities into the circulation\\nand increase right atrial pressure and thus cardiac output, and a bolus of Ringer’s lactate should be\\ngiven. If these measures are not successful, the patient should receive ephedrine 5–10 mg or\\nphenylephrine 50–100 μg intravenously to sustain a mild vasopressor effect. During a period of\\nhypotension, the mother should receive oxygen by mask to increase oxygen delivery to the\\nuteroplacental bed. Newer spinal needles are associated with a low incidence (1–2%) of spinal\\nheadache (PDPH). As a result, spinal anesthesia is becoming more popular for elective caesarean\\nsurgery.\\nC. Combined Spinal-Epidural Anesthesia\\nThe combination of spinal and epidural technique (CSE) has increased in popularity and may provide\\nrapid and effective anesthesia for caesarean delivery. Advantages of CSE include the rapid onset of\\nsurgical anesthesia with a smaller spinal dose and ability to extend the duration by activation of\\nepidural anesthesia. The use of smaller local anesthetic dose may decrease the incidence of maternal\\nhypotension, which can be significantly detrimental both to the mother and the fetus.\\nGeneral Anesthesia\\nGeneral anesthesia is indicated for caesarean delivery when regional techniques cannot be used\\nbecause of coagulopathy, infection, hypovolemia, or urgency. Some patients prefer to be “put to\\nsleep” and refuse regional techniques.\\nIdeally, general anesthesia for caesarean delivery should cause the mother to be unconscious, feel\\nno pain, and have no unpleasant memories of the procedure; the fetus should not be jeopardized, with\\nminimal depression and intact reflex irritability.\\nGeneral anesthesia for caesarean delivery is substantially modified from the typical nonobstetric\\ntechnique. A rapid sequence technique is used with cricoid pressure to prevent aspiration, with\\nrecognition that the risks for the term obstetric patient include (1) full stomach (and aspiration), (2)\\ndifficulty with laryngoscopy and intubation, and (3) rapid desaturation if intubation is unsuccessful.\\nA. Patient Preparation\\nPreoperative medication usually is not required when the patient is brought to the caesarean section\\nroom. Alert the patient preoperatively that she may have a lucid “window” during the operative\\nprocedure when she experiences pain or hears voices. Explain that the condition results from the need\\nto maintain a light analgesic state in order to protect the fetus from large doses of drugs. The patient\\nshould be prepared with 30 mL of nonparticulate antacid to offset gastric acidity. The patient is given\\n100% oxygen with a close-fitting mask for 3 minutes before induction.\\nB. Procedure\\nWhen the surgeon is ready to make the incision, thiopental 2.5 mg/kg should be injected intravenously\\nand cricoid pressure exerted by an assistant. Immediately, succinylcholine 120–140 mg intravenously\\nshould be administered, and intubation and inflation of the cuff performed. Intubation is confirmed by\\nauscultation and monitoring end-tidal CO\\n2\\n before the cricoid pressure is released and the incision\\nmade.

Postoperative analgesia\\ncan be provided by patient-controlled administration of morphine or meperidine.\\nWith this approach, good neonatal outcomes are anticipated if induction-to-delivery times and\\nuterine entry-to-delivery times are kept to a minimum.\\nLocal Anesthesia\\nLocal infiltration anesthesia as a primary technique for caesarean delivery is very rarely used. When\\nused, local anesthesia is performed to provide supplemental anesthesia in patients with inadequate\\nepidural or spinal blockade. However, there may be situations when regional or general anesthesia is\\nnot immediately available, and caesarean delivery under local anesthesia may be necessary for fetal\\nindications (eg, prolonged fetal bradycardia during the first stage of labor). The general nerve supply\\nof the abdominal wall is composed of 6 of the lowest thoracic nerves, the ilioinguinal and the\\niliohypogastric nerves bilaterally. The 3 primary nerves that make up the sensory input from the\\nabdomen all end as anterior cutaneous nerves in the abdominal wall. For emergent caesarean delivery,\\none can use 1% lidocaine in a 10-mL syringe with a 3.5-inch 25-gauge spinal needle injected just\\nunder the skin from the umbilicus to near \\nsymphysis pubis. If the knife follows this line during\\nincision, the patient will not feel pain. Then, the subcutaneous, muscle and rectal sheath layers are\\ninjected as the abdomen is opened. This is the most rapid method for analgesia and delivery by\\ncaesarean section and may be a choice in cases in which anesthesia is not available or possible for a\\nperiod of time. The major disadvantages of local infiltration are the potential for systemic toxicity and\\ntechnical difficulties in providing adequate anesthesia for surgery, but it can be life-saving for the\\nfetus when immediate delivery is needed for fetal indications.\\nANESTHESIA FOR SPECIAL OBSTETRICAL CIRCUMSTANCES\\nMultiple Gestations\\nA. Psychoanalgesia\\nThe psychoprophylactic technique helps to prepare the patient for the intrapartum experience. When\\nthe labor progresses normally, psychoanalgesia can effectively reduce apprehension and enhance the\\npleasurable aspects of childbirth. It also may prepare the patient for an understanding of some of the\\ncomplications of multiple gestations (uterine inertia in the first stage of labor, uterine atony in the\\nthird stage, and possible need for caesarean delivery) and reduce the total amount of drugs required\\nfor analgesia.\\nB. Pudendal Nerve Block\\nPudendal nerve block usually is reserved for cases in which epidural block is not available.

Ideal management entails the use of lumbar epidural\\nblock for the first stage of labor and low caudal block for the late second stage of labor. Epidural\\nanesthesia does not affect fetal outcome with twin delivery but has the advantage of enabling the\\nobstetrician to intervene more easily if the second twin presents abnormally. The need for a general\\nanesthetic can be avoided if an epidural is in place and a caesarean section is required urgently for\\ndelivery of the second twin.\\nD. Spinal Block\\nThe low subarachnoid block is rarely used at the end of the second stage for crowning, delivery, and\\nepisiotomy. A low spinal block does not provide a sufficiently high block for caesarean section should\\nit be required urgently (eg, in malpresentation or cord prolapse of the second twin). Therefore, an\\nepidural anesthetic is always preferable for the labor and delivery of multiple births.\\nE. Inhalation Analgesics\\nNitrous oxide is the only inhalation anesthetic that is analgesic at low concentrations. Experience is\\nneeded to use nitrous oxide safely because the pregnant patient is sensitive to the drug’s anesthetic\\neffects and she can easily become obtunded.

Neonatal depression is\\nmore likely if the induction-to-delivery time is long (>8 minutes), especially if the uterine incision-to-\\ndelivery time also is prolonged (>3 minutes).\\nMidforceps Delivery\\nMidforceps delivery is rarely used in current practice given the limited number of practitioners skilled\\nin the technique. Midforceps delivery generally involves both rotation and traction. Therefore, the\\nanesthetic regimen must provide relaxation as well as analgesia for the perineum, lower vagina, and\\nupper birth canal. In order for the obstetrician to perform the procedures necessary for delivery,\\noptimal conditions must be provided so that maternal and fetal trauma can be minimized. Regional\\nanalgesia with a lumbar, caudal, epidural, or subarachnoid block is preferred because these blocks\\nprovide analgesia and optimal relaxation.\\nThe Trapped Head\\nOn the rare occasion when breech delivery is complicated by a trapped head, the application of forceps\\nor other manipulations may be required urgently. If an epidural block is in place, no further analgesia\\nwill be required; however, if one is not in place, immediate anesthesia and pelvic relaxation will be\\nrequired to facilitate rapid delivery and minimize trauma. The best technique for this purpose is\\ngeneral anesthesia with halothane after suitable protection of the patient from the hazards of\\naspiration. Protection should include use of antacid 30 mL orally and adequate oxygenation, followed\\nby thiopental 200 mg intravenously, succinylcholine 80–100 mg intravenously, and rapid intubation\\nwith cricoid pressure. Another approach described in the literature is administration of 50–100 μg\\nintravenous nitroglycerin to relax the lower uterine segment.\\nPreeclampsia–Eclampsia\\nThis syndrome is classically described as the proteinuric hypertension.

Preeclampsia–eclampsia\\naccounts for approximately 20% of maternal deaths per year in the United States.

As gestation lengthens, there is a tendency toward a fluid shift from the vascular to the\\nextravascular compartment with resultant hypovolemia—in spite of an expanded extracellular fluid\\nspace.\\nIt is estimated that nearly 50% of eclamptic patients who die have myocardial hemorrhages or\\nareas of focal necrosis. Major disorders of central nervous system function probably are caused by\\ncerebral vasospasm. Optimal anesthetic management of these patients during the intrapartum period\\nmust include a careful preanesthetic evaluation of the cardiovascular and central nervous systems.\\nThe physiologic changes of severe preeclampsia–eclampsia are exaggerated by regional block as a\\nresult of restricted intravascular volume, which may lead to considerable depression of blood\\npressure. Small subgroups of these patients suffer from reduced cardiac output (compared with normal\\npregnancy), decreased intravascular fluid space, and marked increases in SVR. Patients with severe\\nhemodynamic changes may require direct monitoring of pulmonary artery and wedge pressures to\\nmanage labor and the effects of epidural anesthesia. Uterine blood flow is increased with epidural\\nblock because of the favorable reduction of SVR, as long as central filling pressures and mean arterial\\npressure are well maintained.\\nRegional and general anesthesia is used in the management of preeclamptic patients.\\nContraindications to regional anesthesia include coagulopathy and urgency for delivery in the setting\\nof nonreassuring fetal testing. The latter may mitigate against taking excessive time for placing a\\nspinal or epidural if the baby requires immediate delivery.\\nEpidural anesthesia may be preferred to spinal anesthesia in cases of severe hypertension. The\\nmore graduated onset of sympathetic block with this technique is thought to produce less hypotension\\nthan would occur with spinal block. However, recent evidence suggests that adequate volume\\npreloading of these patients, who by definition are depleted intravascularly, results in similar\\nhemodynamic responses to both regional techniques. More study is required to confirm these findings.\\nHowever, spinal and epidural anesthesia now usually is encouraged for the management of\\npreeclamptic patients. Obstetricians have become aware that epidural anesthesia is a valuable adjunct\\nin the management of hypertension as a result of the pain relief as well as the vasodilation produced\\nby epidural block. In the past, epidural anesthesia was avoided because of an exaggerated concern over\\nhypotension; now epidural anesthesia is encouraged if the patient’s volume status is well managed and\\nif coagulopathy does not complicate the clinical picture.\\nHemorrhage and Shock\\nIntrapartum obstetric emergencies demand immediate diagnosis and therapy for a favorable outcome\\nfor the mother and fetus.

Aggressive obstetric management may be indicated, but superior anesthetic\\nmanagement will play a major role in reducing maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality rates. The\\nprimary threat to the mother is blood loss, which reduces her effective circulating blood volume and\\nher oxygenation potential. Similarly, the chief hazard to the fetus is diminished uteroplacental\\nperfusion secondary to maternal hypovolemia and hypotension. The perinatal mortality rate associated\\nwith placenta previa and abruptio placentae ranges from 15–20% in some studies and up to 50–100%\\nin other studies.

Several safety measures must be taken. (1) Give 30 mL of a nonparticulate\\nantacid (sodium citrate) within 15 minutes of induction.

Limited imaging can be performed during pregnancy if results would\\nsignificantly alter management. The second trimester is the preferred time for nonurgent surgery.\\nSurgery should not be delayed in any trimester if systemic infection or severe disease is suspected, as\\nthis is associated with higher risk to mother and fetus. Whenever possible, regional anesthesia should\\nbe performed. Pregnancy does not change prognosis, which depends largely on the extent of disease at\\ndiagnosis. A multidisciplinary approach with maternal–fetal medicine, surgery, anesthesia, and\\nneonatology during treatment planning is invaluable to ensure optimal outcomes for both the mother\\nand fetus.\\nSurgical interventions other than caesarean section are performed in 1.5–2.0% of all pregnancies.\\nAltered anatomy and physiology and potential risks to the mother and fetus make diagnosis and\\nmanagement of surgical disorders more difficult during pregnancy. The interests of mother and fetus\\nare best served by the obstetrician’s active participation with the anesthesiologist, neonatologist, and\\ngeneral surgeon throughout the mother’s diagnosis and management of a nonobstetric surgical\\ndisorder. It is imperative that the obstetrician be well informed about the ways in which surgical\\ndisorders influence pregnancy and vice versa, the risks of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures to the\\nfetus, and appropriate management of preterm labor in the immediate postoperative period.\\nSurgical disorders can be either incidental to or directly related to the pregnancy. Diagnostic\\nevaluation requires gentle, sensitive elicitation of physical signs, at times without sophisticated\\ndiagnostic aids that involve risk to the developing fetus. Good judgment regarding the timing,\\nmethods, and extent of treatment is important. In the absence of peritonitis, visceral perforation, or\\nhemorrhage, surgical disorders during gestation generally have little effect on placental function and\\nfetal development.\\nMATERNAL CONSIDERATIONS\\nPregnancy is accompanied by physiologic and anatomic changes that alter the evaluation and\\nmanagement of the surgical patient. The 30–50% increase in plasma volume during pregnancy affects\\ncardiac output and may alter drug distribution and laboratory test results. Red cell mass increases but\\nnot as much as the plasma volume, resulting in a slight physiologic anemia. Colloid osmotic pressure\\nis decreased during pregnancy. Increased interstitial fluid is seen as mild edema, particularly in the\\nlower extremities. Systemic vascular resistance decreases during pregnancy.

Assessment of the risks and benefits to the mother is relatively easy\\nbut less so for the fetus because of its relative inaccessibility.\\nA number of imaging modalities are available for diagnosis during pregnancy, including ultrasound\\n(US), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), and x-ray.\\nRadiation Exposure\\nAlthough no definite harmful effects from the diagnostic use of US and MRI during pregnancy are\\nreported, exposure to radiation is associated with fetal risks. Limited diagnostic CT or x-ray\\nprocedures can be undertaken with care in the pregnant patient. The fetus should be shielded whenever\\npossible. The risk of adverse fetal effects associated with radiation exposure changes with gestational\\nage and is related to the radiation dose to the fetus. These risks fall principally into 2 categories:\\nteratogenicity and carcinogenicity. For example, within 2 weeks of fertilization, the embryo is most\\nsusceptible to implantation failure. If implantation was not affected, teratogenicity is extremely\\nunlikely. Before 8 weeks, the fetus is at risk for radiation-induced growth restriction. At 8–15 weeks,\\nthe embryo is the most susceptible to mental retardation, with an approximately 4% risk on exposure\\nat 10 cGy and 60% at 150 cGy. Teratogenic effects are unlikely in embryos older than 20 weeks. The\\nmost common fetal defects seen with direct fetal irradiation of 10 cGy or more are microcephaly,\\nmental retardation, intrauterine growth restriction, and eye abnormalities. Current evidence suggests\\nno increased structural or developmental fetal risk with radiation doses less than 5 cGy. The second\\nset of concerns exists regarding in utero radiation exposure and its association with an increase in\\nchildhood neoplasms. The risk appears to be dose-related. Natural background fetal radiation exposure\\nis estimated at 0.1 cGy. Fetal exposure to 2–5 cGy is estimated to translate into a relative risk of 1.5–\\n2.0 for fatal childhood cancer, recognizing that the absolute risk is still very low (2 in 2000). \\nTable\\n25–1\\n outlines estimates of fetal radiation exposure with various diagnostic procedures.\\nTable 25–1\\n.

Given the existing data, the American College of Radiology states that definitive\\nconclusions regarding the safety of intravascular iodinated contrast use cannot be made and\\nrecommends its use in pregnancy only if necessary. Before administration, it is important to weigh\\ninformation that will be obtained by the addition of iodine contrast and to obtain informed consent. It\\nis essential that infants whose mothers have received iodine contrast have thyroid function tested\\npostnatally.\\nGadolinium crosses the placenta and is thought to be excreted by the fetal kidneys into the amniotic\\nfluid.

The\\nAmerican College of Radiology discourages its use in pregnancy, stating it should be used only if\\nabsolutely essential and following informed consent.

Generally, the safety of nonobstetric surgery in\\npregnancy and general anesthesia has been well established. Nevertheless, some increased risks are\\nassociated with surgery and anesthesia during pregnancy, and purely elective surgical procedures\\nshould be postponed until after pregnancy. Individual studies have suggested a possible increase in\\nneural tube defects; other registries have documented adverse effects including low birth weight,\\nprematurity, intrauterine growth restriction, and early neonatal death, but they are thought to correlate\\nwith the underlying condition that necessitates the surgical procedure. A review of 54 articles\\ndocumenting pregnancy outcomes of nonobstetric surgical procedures between 1966 and 2002 found a\\nlow rate of miscarriage, congenital abnormalities, and preterm birth, but firm conclusions cannot be\\nmade, as no suitable control group existed. Thus, despite the general safety of anesthetic agents in\\npregnancy, some concern remains regarding teratogenicity in early gestation, and all but truly\\nemergent surgery should be postponed until the second trimester. The second trimester is the preferred\\nsurgery time over the third trimester, as the risk of preterm labor and spontaneous abortion is lowest\\nat that time. Whenever possible, regional anesthesia should be performed. No known reproductive\\ntoxicity is associated with currently used local anesthetic agents at recommended dose ranges. Short-\\nterm postoperative use of narcotic analgesic agents, frequently in combination with acetaminophen or\\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs before 32 weeks, generally appears to produce no adverse fetal\\neffects.\\nBecause intrauterine asphyxia is a major risk to the fetus consequent to maternal surgery,\\nmonitoring and maintaining maternal oxygen-carrying capacity, oxygen affinity, arterial PO\\n2\\n, and\\nplacental blood flow throughout the preoperative, operative, and postoperative periods are important.\\nFor gestations greater than 18 weeks, attention should be given to providing uterine displacement to\\nprevent venocaval compression when the patient is in the supine position. Supplemental oxygen\\nadministration and maintenance of circulating volume also assist fetal oxygenation. A reduction in\\nmaternal blood pressure can lead directly to fetal hypoxia. Greater reductions in uteroplacental\\nperfusion by direct vascular constriction and an increase in uterine tonus are noted in association with\\nthe use of vasopressors, especially those with predominantly α-adrenergic activity. Ephedrine, with its\\nperipheral beta-adrenergic effect, produces much less vasospasm and has traditionally been the\\nvasopressor of choice in the pregnant patient, especially for treating hypotensive complications of\\nregional anesthesia. More recent data find phenylephrine a good alternative with no untoward fetal\\neffects.\\nTo ensure fetal well-being, continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring should be used when\\nmaternal surgery is performed after 24 weeks as long as the monitoring device can function outside\\nthe sterile surgical field.

Premature labor does not appear to be a common result of procedures such as\\nexploratory laparotomy unless visceral perforation and peritonitis are encountered or a low pelvic\\nprocedure is performed with significant uterine manipulation.

Peritoneal signs can be less obvious in\\npregnancy as the uterus may displace the infected organ from contact with the parietal peritoneum.\\nCramping with lower central abdominal pain suggests a uterine disorder. Lower abdominal pain on\\neither side suggests torsion, rupture, or hemorrhage of an ovarian cyst or tumor. Right lower or\\nmidabdominal pain suggests appendicitis. Disorders of the descending and sigmoid colon with left\\nlower quadrant pain are infrequently encountered because of the relatively young age of obstetric\\npatients. Midabdominal pain early in gestation suggests an intestinal origin. Upper abdominal pain is\\noften related to the liver, spleen, gallbladder, stomach, duodenum, or pancreas. Constipation is a\\ncommon problem but is rarely associated with other symptoms.\\nOther Symptoms\\nAbdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting after the first trimester usually suggests a\\ngastrointestinal disorder. Nausea and vomiting associated with the inability to pass gas or stool points\\nto an intestinal obstruction. Diarrhea is seldom encountered in association with acute surgical\\nproblems except as a symptom of recurrent ulcerative colitis.'),\n",

If general anesthesia is anticipated, it is important to consider the physiologic changes in\\npregnancy, such as increased oropharyngeal swelling and decreased glottic opening, which can\\ncomplicate intubation and ventilation. Obesity and preeclampsia can exacerbate these difficulties,\\nleading to aspiration, failed intubation, and subsequent maternal and fetal hypoxia.

In general, elective\\nsurgery should be avoided during pregnancy, but operation should be performed promptly for definite\\nor probable acute disorders.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Clinical Findings\\nAcute appendicitis is the most common extrauterine complication of pregnancy for which surgery is\\nperformed. Suspected appendicitis accounts for nearly two-thirds of all nonobstetric exploratory\\nceliotomies performed during pregnancy; most cases occur in the second and third trimesters.\\nAppendicitis occurs in 0.1–1.4 per 1000 pregnancies. Although the incidence of disease is not\\nincreased during gestation, rupture of the appendix occurs 2–3 times more often during pregnancy\\nsecondary to delays in diagnosis and operation. Maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality rates\\nare greatly increased when appendicitis is complicated by peritonitis.\\nA. Symptoms & Signs\\nThe diagnosis of appendicitis in pregnancy is challenging. Signs and symptoms often are atypical and\\nnot dramatic. Right lower quadrant or middle quadrant pain almost always is present when acute\\nappendicitis occurs in pregnancy but may be ascribed to so-called round ligament pain or urinary tract\\ninfection. In nonpregnant women, the appendix is located in the right lower quadrant (65%), in the\\npelvis (30%), or retrocecally (5%). Traditionally it was taught that pregnancy displaces the appendix\\nupwardly. However, some retrospective studies suggest that there is only minimal appendiceal\\nmigration throughout pregnancy.\\nThe most consistent clinical symptom encountered in pregnant women with appendicitis is vague\\npain on the right side of the abdomen, although atypical pain patterns abound. Muscle guarding and\\nrebound tenderness are much less demonstrable as gestation progresses. If pain changes from\\nlocalized tenderness to a more diffuse nature, appendiceal perforation should be suspected. Rectal and\\nvaginal tenderness are present in 80% of patients, particularly in early pregnancy. Nausea, vomiting,\\nand anorexia usually are present, as in the nonpregnant patient. During early appendicitis, the\\ntemperature and pulse rate are relatively normal. High fever is not characteristic of the disease, and\\n25% of pregnant women with appendicitis are afebrile.\\nB. Laboratory Findings\\nThe relative leukocytosis of pregnancy (normal 6000–16,000/μL) clouds interpretation of infection.\\nAlthough not all patients with appendicitis have white blood cell counts above 16,000/μL, at least 75%\\nshow a left shift in the differential. Urinalysis may reveal significant pyuria (20%) as well as\\nmicroscopic hematuria. This is particularly true in the latter half of pregnancy, when the appendix\\nmigrates closer to the retroperitoneal ureter.\\nC. Imaging\\nIn the nonpregnant patient, CT of the abdomen with and without contrast has become an important\\ntool aiding in the diagnosis of appendicitis. To avoid the risk of radiation to the fetus, US has a\\ndistinct role as the first-line imaging modality in pregnancy (\\nFig. 25–1\\n). Graded compression\\nultrasonography has been found to have a high positive predictive value but average sensitivity in\\ndiagnosing appendicitis. MRI is helpful in further aiding the diagnosis in patients for whom\\nsonographic findings are nondiagnostic. If US is nondiagnostic and MRI is not available, CT may be\\nappropriate. A noncompressible appendix on ultrasound is abnormal, whereas MRI or CT may\\ndemonstrate an enlarged, fluid-filled appendix with or without a fecalith. An appendix measuring > 6\\nmm should be considered abnormal.'),\n",

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='of third-trimester patients. Most preterm deliveries occur within the first postoperative week.\\nPerinatal loss may occur in association with preterm labor and delivery or with generalized peritonitis\\nand sepsis, occurring in 0–1.5% of uncomplicated appendicitis cases. Twenty-five percent of pregnant\\nwomen with appendicitis will progress to perforation; this risk is greatest when surgery is delayed\\nmore than 24 hours. With appendiceal rupture, fetal loss rates are reportedly as high as 30%, and\\nmaternal mortality rates as high as 4% are reported. This is of particular concern because appendiceal\\nrupture occurs most frequently in the third trimester.\\nTreatment\\nImmediate surgical intervention is indicated once the diagnosis of appendicitis is made. In the setting\\nof active labor, the surgery should be performed immediately postpartum. Delaying treatment\\nincreases the risk of perforation, which in turn increases the risk of fetal loss. Under appropriate\\nconditions, laparoscopic appendectomy may be as safe as open appendectomy. A systematic review of\\n637 cases of laparoscopic appendectomy showed a significantly higher rate of fetal loss (6% vs.\\n3.1%), though equal or lesser rates of preterm delivery compared with open appendectomy. Large\\nseries report a negative surgical exploration rate between 13% and as high as 55%, likely due to the\\nmany processes that may mimic appendicitis in pregnancy. When the appendix appears normal at\\nlaparotomy, careful exploration for other nonobstetric and obstetric conditions is important.\\nTreatment of nonperforated acute appendicitis complicating pregnancy is appendectomy. A single\\ndose of preoperative prophylactic antibiotics should be routinely given. In the setting of perforation,\\nperitonitis, or abscess formation, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics should be continued until\\nculture and sensitivities can narrow antibiotic choice. If drainage is necessary for generalized\\nperitonitis, drains should be placed transabdominally and not transvaginally. During the first\\ntrimester, a transverse incision at McBurney’s point or over the area of maximal tenderness is\\ngenerally considered appropriate. If the diagnosis is not certain, a vertical midline incision can be\\nmade. Laparoscopy is an alternate surgical approach used with increasing frequency, especially in the\\nfirst half of pregnancy. In the late second or third trimester, a muscle-splitting incision centered over\\nthe point of maximal tenderness usually provides optimal appendiceal exposure. As a rule,\\nappendiceal disease is managed and the pregnancy is left alone. A Smead-Jones combined mass and\\nfascial closure with secondary wound closure 72 hours later may be advisable when the appendix is\\ngangrenous or perforated or in the presence of peritonitis or abscess formation.\\nInduced abortion is rarely indicated. Depending on the gestational age and expert neonatal care\\navailable, abdominal delivery occasionally is performed when peritonitis, sepsis, or a large\\nappendiceal or cul-de-sac abscess occurs. Data are limited, so making definitive recommendations\\nregarding the use of prophylactic tocolytics is difficult. It appears unnecessary in uncomplicated\\nappendicitis but may be appropriate with advanced disease. Caution is indicated because of reports\\nthat tocolytics are associated with an increased risk of pulmonary edema in women with sepsis. Labor\\nthat follows shortly after surgery in the late third trimester should be allowed to progress because it is\\nnot associated with a significant risk of wound dehiscence. At times, the large uterus may help wall\\noff an infection, which after delivery may become disrupted, leading to an acute abdomen within\\nhours postpartum.\\nPrognosis\\nBetter fluid and nutritional support, use of antibiotics, safer anesthesia, prompt surgical intervention,\\nand improved surgical technique have been important elements in the significant reduction of\\nmaternal mortality from appendicitis during pregnancy.

Gallstones are responsible for 90% of cholecystitis in Western\\ncountries; parasitic infections are a less common cause. Acute cholecystitis occurs in 1 in 1600 to 1 in\\n10,000 pregnancies. Well-described risk factors for cholelithiasis are age, female sex, fertility,\\nobesity, and family history. It has been estimated that at least 3.5% of pregnant women harbor\\ngallstones. Multiparas are at increased risk of gallbladder disease. Both progesterone and estrogen\\nincrease bile lithogenicity; progesterone decreases gallbladder contractility. These changes are seen\\nby the end of the first trimester of pregnancy.\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\nSigns and symptoms are similar to those seen in the non-pregnant state and include anorexia, nausea,\\nvomiting, dyspepsia, and intolerance of fatty foods. Biliary tract disease may cause right upper\\nquadrant, epigastric, right scapular, shoulder, and even left upper quadrant or left lower quadrant pain\\nthat tends to be episodic. Biliary colic attacks often are of acute onset, seemingly are triggered by\\nmeals, and may last from a few minutes to several hours. Fever, right upper quadrant pain, and\\ntenderness under the liver with deep inspiration (Murphy’s sign) are often present in patients with\\nacute cholecystitis. In severe cases the patient may have mild jaundice or appear septic.'),\n",

Laboratory Findings\\nAn elevated white blood cell count with an increase in immature forms is seen with acute\\ncholecystitis. Aspartate transaminase (AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels are often\\nincreased. Modest increases in the alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels are anticipated very early\\nin cholecystitis or common duct obstruction. However, a more characteristic pattern of relatively\\nnormal AST and ALT levels with elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin levels is generally found\\nafter the first day of the attack. These changes are not diagnostic and do not signify common bile duct\\nstone or obstruction alone, but when present they serve to support the diagnosis. Elevated lipase and\\namylase support the diagnosis of an associated pancreatitis.\\nC. Imaging\\nUS findings of gallbladder stones, a thickened gallbladder wall, fluid collection around the\\ngallbladder, a dilated common bile duct, or even swelling in the pancreas are suggestive of\\ncholelithiasis and cholecystitis. The diagnostic accuracy of US for detecting gallstones in pregnancy is\\n95%, making it the diagnostic test of choice.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe major diagnostic difficulty imposed by pregnancy is differentiating between cholecystitis and\\nappendicitis. In addition to its association with gallstones, cholecystitis can be infectious secondary to\\nSalmonella typhi\\n or parasites. A number of other lesions of the biliary tract occur rarely during\\ngestation, including choledochal cysts, which are seen as a spherical dilatation of the common bile\\nduct with a very narrow or obstructed distal end. Associated pancreatitis may be present. Severe\\npreeclampsia with associated right upper quadrant abdominal pain and abnormal liver function tests;\\nhemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome; acute fatty liver of\\npregnancy; and acute viral hepatitis are in the differential diagnosis. The presence of proteinuria,\\nnondependent edema, hypertension, and sustained increases in AST and ALT levels compared with\\nalkaline phosphatase level are clinical and laboratory features usually associated with preeclampsia.\\nPeptic ulcer disease, myocardial infarction, and herpes zoster also have overlapping symptoms.\\nComplications\\nSecondary infection with enteric flora such as \\nEscherichia coli, Klebsiella\\n, or \\nStreptococcus faecalis\\ncomplicates one-fifth of cases. Pancreatitis may frequently accompany cholecystitis during\\npregnancy. Removal of the gallbladder and gallstones may be preferred over conservative medical\\ntherapy when pancreatitis is concurrent, as it is associated with fetal loss in 3–20% of pregnant\\npatients. Other uncommon complications of cholecystitis during gestation are retained intraductal\\nstones, gangrenous cholecystitis, galbladder perforation with biliary peritonitis, cholecystoenteric\\nfistulas, and ascending cholangitis.\\nTreatment\\nThe initial management of symptomatic cholelithiasis and cholecystitis in pregnancy is nonoperative\\nwith bowel rest, \\nintravenous hydration, correction of electrolyte imbalances, and analgesics.

A laboratory serum amylase level that is more than 2 times\\nabove the upper limit of normal suggests pancreatitis. However, an elevated serum amylase level is\\nnot specific for pancreatitis because cholecystitis, bowel obstruction, hepatic trauma, or a perforated\\nduodenal ulcer can cause similar serum amylase level elevations. Serum amylase levels usually return\\nto normal within a few days of an attack of uncomplicated acute pancreatitis.

Volvulus is much more prevalent during pregnancy; the risk is greatest when uterine size\\nrapidly changes (eg, second trimester and immediately postpartum).\\nClinical Findings\\nThe same classic triad of abdominal pain, vomiting, and obstipation is observed in pregnant and\\nnonpregnant women with intestinal obstruction. Pain may be diffuse, constant, or periodic, occurring\\nevery 4–5 minutes with small-bowel obstruction or every 10–15 minutes with large-bowel obstruction.\\nBowel sounds are of little value in making an early diagnosis of obstruction, and tenderness to\\npalpation typically is absent with early obstruction. Vomiting occurs early with small-bowel\\nobstruction. Guarding and rebound tenderness are observed in association with strangulation or\\nperforation. Late in the course of disease, fever, oliguria, and shock occur as manifestations of\\nmassive fluid loss into the bowel, acidosis, and infection. The classic findings of bowel ischemia\\ninclude fever, tachycardia, localized abdominal pain, marked leukocytosis, and metabolic acidosis.\\nUnfortunately, most laboratory abnormalities arise once bowel ischemia has progressed to bowel\\nnecrosis.\\nThe diagnosis usually is confirmed by radiologic studies, which should be obtained when intestinal\\nobstruction is suspected. A single abdominal series (upright and supine abdominal film) is\\nnondiagnostic in up to 50% of early cases, but serial films usually reveal progressive changes that\\nconfirm the diagnosis. Volvulus should be suspected when a single, grossly dilated loop of bowel is\\nseen. A volvulus primarily occurs at the cecum but may also be seen at the sigmoid colon.\\nOccasionally, more extensive radiologic imaging is indicated, given the high risk of fetal death with\\ndelayed treatment.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum in the second and third trimesters should be viewed with\\ncaution and made only after gastrointestinal causes of the symptoms including pancreatitis have been\\nexcluded. Mesenteric ischemia, adynamic ileus of the colon, and acute colonic pseudo-obstruction\\n(Ogilvie’s syndrome) are included in the differential diagnosis but are rarely seen during pregnancy.\\nPrognosis\\nIntestinal obstruction in pregnancy is associated with a maternal mortality rate of 6%, often secondary\\nto infection and irreversible shock. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for an improved\\noutcome. Perinatal mortality is approximately 20% and usually results from maternal hypotension and'),\n",

The cornerstones of therapy are bowel decompression, intravenous hydration,\\ncorrection of electrolyte imbalances, and timely surgery when indicated. The patient’s condition must\\nbe rapidly stabilized. The amount of fluid loss often is underestimated and may be 1–6 L by the time\\nobstruction is identified on a scout film. Aggressive hydration is needed to support both the mother\\nand the fetus. A nasogastric tube should be placed. Colonoscopy has been used successfully in the\\nreduction of volvulus averting laparotomy.

Surgery is mandatory if perforation or\\ngangrenous bowel is suspected or when the patient’s symptoms do not resolve with medical\\nmanagement.

Surgical principles for intraoperative management apply similarly to pregnant\\nand nonpregnant patients.

As many as 1–4% of pregnant women are diagnosed with an adnexal mass.\\nThe majority of the masses are functional or corpus luteum cysts and spontaneously resolve by 16\\nweeks’ gestation. More than 90% of unilateral, non-complex masses less than 5 cm in diameter that\\nare noticed in the first trimester are functional and resolve spontaneously. Patients who undergo\\nassisted reproduction present a special subgroup, as their ovaries frequently have ovarian cysts in the\\nfirst trimester due to ovarian hyperstimulation. Pathologic ovarian neoplasms tend not to resolve. The\\nmost common pathologic ovarian neoplasms during pregnancy are benign cystic teratoma, serous or\\nmucinous cystadenoma, and cystic corpus luteum. Of the adnexal masses that persist, 1–10% will be\\nmalignant.\\nClinical Findings\\nMost adnexal masses discovered during pregnancy are found as incidental findings at time of\\nultrasound performed for evaluation of the fetus. Thus most women are asymptomatic for the ovarian\\nmass. However, some women may experience pelvic pain or discomfort related to the mass.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nOvarian masses must be differentiated from lesions of the colon, pedunculated leiomyomas, pelvic\\nkidneys, and congenital abnormalities of the uterus.

If the adnexal mass is complex, laparoscopy may be considered if intact removal in an\\nendoscopic bag is feasible. If an open approach is taken, the incision needs to be of sufficient size not\\nonly to remove the tumor intact, but also to properly explore the abdomen and to reduce uterine\\nmanipulation until the definitive surgical course of management is determined. Upon abdominal\\nentry, peritoneal washings should be obtained and the contralateral ovary examined. If abnormal in\\nappearance, biopsy should be performed; otherwise, routine biopsy is unnecessary. Adequate tissue\\nshould be obtained for histologic diagnosis on frozen section. If the tumor is benign, residual ovarian\\ntissue should be conserved if possible.\\nIf malignant, staging is performed. Conservative surgery is appropriate for an encapsulated tumor\\nif no evidence of uterine or contralateral ovarian involvement is seen. In more advanced stages, the\\nextent of surgery, including tumor debulking, will depend on gestational age and the patient’s wishes\\nwith regard to the pregnancy. Early termination of pregnancy does not improve outcome of ovarian\\ncancer. In some cases, optimal surgical cytoreduction of the tumor to <1cm residual disease can be\\naccomplished with the uterus and pregnancy left in situ. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy may offer an\\ninterim treatment for selected patients diagnosed at midgestation to allow for fetal maturity before\\nextensive surgical cyto-reduction. Elevated tumor markers, such as α-fetoprotein, lactate\\ndehydrogenase, β-human chorionic gonadotropin, and cancer antigen-125, during the preoperative\\nworkup of an adnexal mass must be interpreted with caution because pregnancy itself may cause an\\nincrease in these values.\\nLEIOMYOMAS\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n The diagnosis of leiomyomas in pregnancy is made based on ultrasound\\nClinical Findings\\nUterine leiomyomas are found in 0.1–3.9% of pregnancies.

The most common malignancies\\ndiagnosed during pregnancy are cervical cancer (26%; see also \\nChapter 48\\n, Premalignant and\\nMalignant Disorders of the Uterine Cervix), breast cancer (26%), leukemias (15%), lymphomas (10%;\\nsee also \\nChapter 34\\n, Hematologic Disorders in Pregnancy), and malignant melanomas (8%). Once\\ncancer is diagnosed during pregnancy, a multidisciplinary team of maternal–fetal medicine\\nspecialists, oncologists, surgeons, and radiation oncologists can assist the patient in making difficult\\ndecisions regarding treatment timing and continued pregnancy.\\nCERVICAL CANCER\\n(See also \\nChapter 48\\n, Premalignant and Malignant Disorders of the Uterine Cervix.)\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n The diagnosis of cervical cancer during pregnancy is usually made on the basis of cervical biopsy\\nafter abnormal pap smear or detection of cervical mass.\\n Pregnancy should not limit evaluation of abnormal cervical cytology or evaluation of a cervical\\nmass.\\nPathogenesis\\nInvasive cervical cancer complicates approximately 0.05% of pregnancies.

Management is determined by the stage of the cancer, the\\ngestational age, and the patient’s desires regarding the pregnancy. Pregnancy does not appear to affect\\nthe prognosis for women with cervical cancer and the fetus is not affected by the maternal disease, but\\nmay suffer morbidity from its treatment (eg, preterm delivery).\\nIf the pregnancy is early and the disease is stage I–IIA, radical hysterectomy and therapeutic\\nlymphadenectomy can be performed with the fetus left in situ, unless the patient is unwilling to\\nterminate the pregnancy. Women at a gestational age closer to fetal viability or who decline\\ntermination may decide to continue the pregnancy after careful discussion regarding the maternal\\nrisks. Delivery in patients with cervical dysplasia and carcinoma in situ may be via the vaginal route.\\nPatients with invasive cervical cancer should be delivered by caesarean section to avoid potential\\ncervical hemorrhage and dissemination of tumor cells during vaginal delivery. A caesarean radical\\nhysterectomy with therapeutic lymphadenectomy is the procedure of choice for patients with stage\\nIA2–IIA2 disease once fetal maturity is established. As in the nonpregnant patient, radiation with\\nconcomitant chemotherapy is used for the treatment of more advanced disease. In the first trimester,\\nirradiation may be carried out with the expectation of spontaneous abortion. In the second trimester,\\ninterruption of the pregnancy by hysterotomy before radiation therapy should be considered, although\\nsome experts advocate proceeding with immediate radiation treatment, again awaiting spontaneous\\nevacuation of the uterus. In selected cases with locally advanced disease in which the patient declines\\npregnancy termination, consideration may be given to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in an effort to\\nprevent disease progression during the time needed to achieve fetal maturity. Delivery should be by\\ncaesarean section. A lymphadenectomy can be performed at the same time. Postpartum the patient\\nshould receive chemoradiation following guidelines established for the nonpregnant patient.\\nBREAST CANCER\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n Women with breast cancer during pregnancy usually present with a breast mass or thickening.\\n The diagnosis is confirmed with biopsy.\\n Pregnancy should not limit a thorough evaluation of a breast mass.\\nBreast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women in the United States. One of every 5\\ncases occurs in women younger than 45 years, and 2–5% of women with breast cancer are pregnant\\nwhen the diagnosis is made. In the United States, the incidence of breast cancer in pregnancy is 3 per\\n10,000 live births. For this reason, careful breast examination should be performed during prenatal\\nand postnatal care, and a family history should be obtained.\\nClinical Findings\\nPregnancy- and lactation-related changes in the breast increase the frequency and range of breast\\nproblems and make the diagnosis of breast cancer more difficult. A painless lump is the most common'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='presentation of gestational breast cancer. Bloody nipple discharge may be a presenting symptom and\\nrequires workup. Any mass found by the patient or by the obstetrician should be fully evaluated\\nwithout undue delay.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe differential diagnosis is broad and includes lactating adenoma, galactocele, milk-filled cyst,\\nfibroadenoma, abscess, and cancer.\\nComplications\\nManagement of the pregnant woman with breast carcinoma is difficult because it requires careful\\nconsideration of both mother and fetus. The general approach to treatment of breast cancer in\\npregnancy should be similar to that in nonpregnant patients and should not be delayed because of\\npregnancy.\\nTreatment\\nInitial management of the pregnant patient with a breast mass does not differ significantly from that\\nfor nonpregnant women. When a localized lesion is present, breast ultrasonography is the preferred\\nfirst imaging modality during pregnancy. It is safe and helpful in distinguishing between cystic and\\nsolid masses. Although the sensitivity of mammography is diminished by the breast changes in\\npregnancy, the study still may be helpful for selected patients with inconclusive ultrasound\\nexaminations. With low-dose mammography and appropriate shielding, fetal radiation exposure is\\nminimal. Nonetheless, it is generally recommended that the procedure be avoided during the first\\ntrimester. Gadolinium-enhanced breast MRI is an imaging technique that may be indicated in selected\\npatients, although there is a paucity of data on MRI features of pregnancy-associated breast cancer.\\nCystic lesions should be aspirated and the fluid, if bloody, examined cytologically. Malignant cells are\\nrarely found in nonbloody fluid. Fine-needle aspiration, core biopsy, or incisional biopsy can be used\\nin some cases, but surgical excisional biopsy may be most appropriate for clinically suspicious or\\ncytologically equivocal lesions. The increased vascularity of the breasts is associated with a higher\\nrate of bleeding, and the lactating breast is prone to infectious complications, but neither pregnancy\\nnor lactation appears to interfere with excisional biopsy in an outpatient setting.\\nBreast cancer is classified according to the tumor-node metastasis (TNM) staging system. If a\\npregnant woman has clinically positive nodes or suspicious symptoms, she should undergo\\nradiographic staging of lung, liver, and bone; asymptomatic women with clinically node-negative\\nearly-stage breast cancer do not. This can be done with plain films with abdominal shielding,\\nabdominal ultrasound, MRI, and radionuclide bone scans, which are thought to be safe in pregnancy.\\nTermination of pregnancy has not been shown to improve survival rates. Modified radical\\nmastectomy is the preferred local management of pregnant patients with breast cancer, with the goal\\nof avoiding the need for adjuvant radiation therapy. Radical mastectomy is well tolerated during\\npregnancy.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy rank among the\\nleading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Approximately 15% of maternal deaths are\\nattributable to hypertension, making it the second leading cause of maternal mortality in the United\\nStates. Severe hypertension increases the mother’s risk of heart attack, cardiac failure, cerebral\\nvascular accidents, and renal failure. The fetus and neonate also are at increased risk from\\ncomplications such as poor placental transfer of oxygen, fetal growth restriction, preterm birth,\\nplacental abruption, stillbirth, and neonatal death.\\nHypertension is defined as a sustained blood pressure higher than 140/90 mm Hg. In the\\nnonpregnant patient, essential hypertension accounts for more than 90% of cases; however, many\\nother conditions must be considered (\\nTable 26–1\\n). In the pregnant patient, hypertension may be\\nattributable to any of the conditions summarized in \\nTable 26–1\\n. In addition, unique forms of\\nhypertension, gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, occur only during pregnancy. Gestational\\nhypertension is characterized by elevated blood pressure diagnosed for the first time during pregnancy\\nin patients without evidence of proteinuria. Preeclampsia is characterized by the onset of hypertension\\nand proteinuria, usually during the third trimester of pregnancy. The National High Blood Pressure\\nEducation Program Working Group stated that edema occurs too frequently in normal pregnant\\nwomen to be a useful marker in the diagnosis of preeclampsia. Therefore, edema is no longer\\nrecommended as a diagnostic criterion for preeclampsia. Management of preeclampsia differs from\\nthe management of other forms of hypertension during pregnancy. Therefore, it is important to\\ndistinguish preeclampsia from other forms of hypertension that may complicate pregnancy.\\nTable 26–1\\n. Causes of chronic hypertension.'),\n",

On the other end of the spectrum is the\\npatient with no evidence of chronic hypertension who experiences the abrupt onset of hypertension\\nand proteinuria late in pregnancy followed by complete resolution postpartum.

It is characterized by a history of\\nhigh blood pressure before pregnancy, elevation of blood pressure during the first half of pregnancy,\\nor high blood pressure that lasts for longer than 12 weeks after delivery. The pathogenesis of chronic\\nhypertension or essential hypertension is poorly understood. Factors that may contribute to the\\ndevelopment of chronic hypertension are derangements in sympathetic neural activity or angiotensin\\nII activity. There appears to be a genetic component in that hypertension is more common in\\nindividuals with a family history of hypertension. Other risk factors that predispose one to develop\\nchronic hypertension during a person’s lifetime are African American race, obesity, dyslipidemia, and\\nphysical inactivity.\\nClinical Findings\\nChronic hypertension is defined as women who have a blood pressure of ≥140 mmHg systolic or ≥90\\nmmHg diastolic before pregnancy, during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, or >12 weeks after\\npregnancy. During the first trimester of pregnancy, women with a history of chronic hypertension will\\nlikely manifest blood pressure elevations. However, during normal pregnancy, maternal blood volume\\nincreases by 40–60%. Cardiac output and renal blood flow increase significantly. Blood pressure\\nnormally decreases throughout the first half of pregnancy under the influence of progesterone,\\nreaching a nadir in midpregnancy and returning to prepregnancy levels by the end of the third\\ntrimester. For this reason, blood pressure may normalize during the second trimester in women with\\nunderlying chronic hypertension.\\nEvaluation of the patient with chronic hypertension is directed at end organs and systems most\\nlikely to be \\naffected by hypertension, including the eyes, heart, kidneys, uteroplacental circulation,\\nand the fetus. Laboratory tests include a complete blood count, glucose screen, electrolyte panel,\\nserum creatinine, urinalysis, and urine culture. In some cases, additional tests may be needed. In\\npatients with possible renal disease (serum creatinine ≥0.8 mg/dL, urine protein >1+ on dipstick), a\\n24-hour urine collection for creatinine clearance and total protein will provide baseline information\\nthat may be helpful in diagnosing the onset of preeclampsia later in pregnancy. An electrocardiogram\\nmay reveal left ventricular hypertrophy in the patient with long-standing hypertension. Chest\\nradiography with abdominal shielding or echocardiogram may reveal cardiomegaly.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nIn women with hypertension, underlying disorders must be excluded (\\nTable 26–1\\n). The search for an\\nunderlying cause should include a complete history and physical examination, taking into account the\\nnormal changes that accompany pregnancy. Blood pressure should be measured in both arms with the\\npatient in a sitting position and the arm at the level of the heart, and multiple measurements should be\\nobtained on different occasions. If possible, measurements should be obtained outside of the office\\nsetting. The fifth Korotkoff sound should be used to determine diastolic pressure. Auscultation of the\\nflanks may reveal a renal artery bruit. Funduscopic examination may reveal typical findings\\nassociated with long-standing hypertension or possibly diabetes. An enlarged thyroid gland may\\nindicate thyroid disease. Absent peripheral pulses suggest coarctation of the aorta. Heart, skin, and\\njoints should be evaluated thoroughly. Antinuclear antibody may help suggest a diagnosis of collagen\\nvascular disease. A suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone level suggests hyperthyroidism.

Unfortunately, the benefit of maternal blood pressure\\ncontrol appears to be limited to preventing maternal morbidities and does not appear to extend to\\nreducing the risk of these obstetric complications.\\nTreatment\\nManagement of the chronic hypertensive patient during pregnancy is targeted to 2 goals: (1) maternal\\nblood pressure control to minimize the risk of maternal complications related to blood pressure\\nelevations such as stroke and myocardial infarction, and (2) early detection of any obstetrical or fetal\\ncomplications related to chronic hypertension.\\nA number of antihypertensives have been shown to be safe and effective during pregnancy in\\ncontrolling maternal blood pressure. Treatment of elevated blood pressure with antihypertensives\\nreduces the risk of maternal morbidities related to hypertension but does not reduce the risk of fetal\\ncomplications such as intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, and placental abruption.\\nA. Treatment of Mild Chronic Hypertension\\nIn pregnant women with mild hypertension and no evidence of renal disease, serious medical\\ncomplications are rare. Moreover, there is no consensus that antihypertensive medication can reduce\\nthe risk of fetal death, growth restriction, placental abruption, preeclampsia, or eclampsia in these\\nwomen. Therefore, antihypertensive medication is not usually necessary. Avoidance of alcohol and\\ntobacco is encouraged. Sodium restriction may be considered (2–3 g/d). Rigorous activity should be\\navoided, as should weight reduction. Despite the lack of evidence supporting the benefit of\\nantihypertensive therapy in women with blood pressure <180/110 mm Hg, many clinicians are\\nreluctant to withhold medication when the blood pressure remains ≥150/100 mm Hg despite lifestyle\\nmodifications.

Antihypertensive Therapy in Chronic Hypertension\\nSeveral choices for initial antihypertensive therapy during pregnancy are available. Methyldopa has\\nbeen studied extensively and is recommended by many as the first-line antihypertensive agent in\\npregnancy. It is a centrally acting alpha-adrenergic agonist that appears to inhibit vasoconstricting\\nimpulses from the medullary vasoregulatory center. The total daily dosage of 500 mg to 2 g is\\nadministered in 2–4 divided doses. Peak plasma levels occur 2–3 hours after administration, and the\\nmaximum effect occurs 4–6 hours after an oral dose. The agent is excreted primarily by the kidney.\\nSedation and postural hypotension are the most common side effects. A positive direct Coombs’ test\\nmay be seen, usually after 6–12 months of therapy. Hemolytic anemia may occur in these patients and'),\n",

Fever, liver function abnormalities, granulocytopenia, and\\nthrombocytopenia are rare side effects.\\nLabetalol is an alpha\\n1\\n-adrenergic blocker and a nonselective beta-adrenergic blocker. The beta-\\nblockade/alpha-blockade ratio is 7:1. A large body of clinical evidence suggests that use of labetalol is\\nsafe during pregnancy. It appears to lack teratogenicity and crosses the placenta in small amounts.\\nOne randomized study showed no advantages of labetalol over methyldopa. Another study reported a\\nhigher incidence of small for gestational age newborns in patients treated with labetalol. The usual\\nstarting dose is 100 mg twice per day (BID), and the dose can be increased weekly to a maximum of\\n2400 mg daily. Titration increments should not exceed 200 mg BID.\\nNifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that has been used during pregnancy for tocolysis and\\ntreatment of hypertension. Several reports suggest that nifedipine use is safe during pregnancy;\\nhowever, the cumulative experience with this agent is not as extensive as with methyldopa and\\nlabetalol. When nifedipine is used for treatment of chronic hypertension during pregnancy, the long-\\nacting formulation (Procardia XL, Adalat CC) may improve patient compliance. The principal benefit\\nof this agent is once-daily dosing. The usual starting dose is 30 mg daily. If necessary, the dose may\\nbe increased to 60–90 mg daily. The neuro-muscular-blocking action of magnesium may be\\npotentiated by simultaneous calcium channel blockade; therefore, nifedipine should be used with\\ncaution in patients receiving magnesium sulfate. The sublingual route of administration is associated\\nwith unpredictable blood levels and should be avoided.\\nOther antihypertensive medications used in pregnancy include atenolol, metoprolol, prazosin,\\nminoxidil, hydralazine, thiazide diuretics, and clonidine. Published experience with these agents is\\nlimited, and they should not supplant methyldopa, labetalol, or nifedipine as first-line agents in\\npregnancy.\\nUse of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (enalapril, captopril) during pregnancy is\\nassociated with fetal hypocalvaria, renal defects, anuria, and fetal and neonatal death. These agents are\\ncontraindicated in pregnancy. With few exceptions, diuretics (furosemide, hydrochlorothiazide)\\nshould be avoided during pregnancy. Fetal bradycardia, growth retardation, and neonatal\\nhypoglycemia have been reported in patients treated with blockers.\\nD. Fetal Assessment in Chronic Hypertension\\nPregnancies complicated by chronic hypertension, regardless of the cause, are at increased risk for\\npoor fetal growth. An initial ultrasound examination should be performed as early as possible to\\nconfirm the due date and to ensure that no obvious fetal anomalies are present. Thereafter, fetal\\ngrowth may be assessed by ultrasound as needed, usually no more frequently than every 2–4 weeks.\\nAntepartum fetal \\nmonitoring usually is started by 32–34 weeks. If the nonstress test is used as the\\nmethod of surveillance, it should be accompanied by assessment of amniotic fluid volume. Doppler\\nvelocimetry of the umbilical, uterine, and middle cerebral arteries are helpful in optimizing the timing\\nof delivery, particularly in cases of suspected fetal growth restriction.\\nPrognosis\\nPregnancy outcome usually is good in patients with mild chronic hypertension and no other serious\\nmedical conditions. Fetal growth restriction, superimposed preeclampsia, placental abruption, and\\npreterm delivery are the most common complications. The outlook is less favorable in women with\\nsevere hypertension early in pregnancy and in those with evidence of end-organ compromise, such as\\nrenal insufficiency and/or cardiovascular disease. By necessity, management is individualized. Close\\nmonitoring for development of fetal growth restriction and superimposed preeclampsia is indicated.'),\n",

The pathogenesis of\\ngestational hypertension is unclear, and it is equally unclear whether gestational hypertension\\nrepresents an early stage of preeclampsia or whether it is an entirely separate disease entity.\\nGestational hypertension is considered to be a provisional diagnosis as many women with gestational\\nhypertension will go on to be diagnosed with either preeclampsia or chronic hypertension. If\\npreeclampsia has not developed and the maternal blood pressure has returned to normal by 12 weeks\\npostpartum, then a diagnosis of transient hypertension of pregnancy is made.\\nClinical Findings\\nA diagnosis of gestational hypertension is made when (1) maternal blood pressure is elevated to ≥140\\nmm Hg systolic or ≥90 mm Hg diastolic on 2 occasions 6 hours apart in a previously normotensive\\nwoman ≥20 weeks’ gestation, and (2) there is no evidence of proteinuria. Gestational hypertension is\\nclassified as mild or severe based on the degree of blood pressure elevation. It is considered to be\\nsevere when the systolic blood pressure is persistently ≥160 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure is\\npersistently ≥110 mm Hg.\\nComplications\\nApproximately 15–25% of women diagnosed with gestational hypertension go on to develop\\npreeclampsia. Women with mild gestational hypertension do not appear to be at increased risk of\\npreterm birth, intrauterine growth restriction, abruption, or stillbirth. Women with severe gestational\\nhypertension, however, are at increased risk of adverse outcomes, including preterm birth, intrauterine\\ngrowth restriction, and placental abruption.\\nTreatment\\nGiven the 15–25% risk of progression to preeclampsia, treatment includes close surveillance for signs\\nand symptoms of preeclampsia. Patient education regarding symptoms of preeclampsia (headache,\\nvisual changes, epigastric or abdominal pain) is recommended. Initial evaluation includes 24-hour\\nurine collection to confirm the absence of significant proteinuria and serum laboratory evaluation to'),\n",

Among daughters of preeclamptic\\nwomen, the risk of preeclampsia is significantly higher than the population risk.

Women destined to develop preeclampsia do not exhibit normal\\nrefractoriness to endogenous vasopressors. As a result, normal expansion of the intravascular space\\ndoes not occur, and the normal decline in blood pressure during the first half of pregnancy may be\\nabsent or attenuated. Despite normal to elevated blood pressure, intravascular volume is reduced.\\nThe etiology of preeclampsia is not known; however, a growing body of evidence suggests that\\nmaternal vascular endothelial injury plays a central role in the disorder. Some reports suggest that\\nendothelial damage in preeclampsia results in decreased endothelial production of prostaglandin I\\n2\\n(prostacyclin), a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation. Endothelial cell injury\\nexposes subendothelial collagen and can trigger platelet aggregation, activation, and release of\\nplatelet-derived thromboxane A\\n2\\n (TXA\\n2\\n), a potent vasoconstrictor and stimulator of platelet\\naggregation. Decreased prostacyclin production by dysfunctional endothelial cells and increased\\nTXA\\n2\\n release by activated platelets and trophoblast may be responsible for reversal of the normal\\nratio of prostacyclin and TXA\\n2\\n observed in preeclampsia. The predominance of TXA\\n2\\n may contribute\\nto the vasoconstriction and hypertension that are central features of the disorder. Elevated\\nintravascular pressure combined with damaged vascular endothelium results in movement of fluid\\nfrom the intravascular to the extravascular spaces, leading to edema in the brain, retinae, lungs, liver,\\nand subcutaneous tissues. Hypertension and glomerular endothelial damage lead to proteinuria. The\\nresultant decrease in intravascular colloid oncotic pressure contributes to further loss of intravascular\\nfluid. Hemoconcentration is reflected in a rising hematocrit. Consumption of platelets and activation\\nof the clotting cascade at the sites of endothelial damage may lead to thrombocytopenia and\\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Soluble fibrin monomers produced by the coagulation\\ncascade may precipitate in the microvasculature, leading to microangiopathic hemolysis and elevation\\nof the serum lactate dehydrogenase level. Cerebral edema, vasoconstriction, and capillary endothelial\\ndamage may lead to hyperreflexia, clonus, convulsions, or hemorrhage. Hepatic edema and/or\\nischemia may lead to hepatocellular injury and elevation of serum transaminases and lactate\\ndehydrogenase levels.

Intravascular\\nfluid loss across damaged capillary endothelium in the lungs may result in pulmonary edema. In the\\nretinae, vasoconstriction and/or edema may lead to visual disturbances, retinal detachment, or\\nblindness. Movement of fluid from the intravascular space into the subcutaneous tissues produces the\\ncharacteristic nondependent edema of preeclampsia.\\nEndothelial damage appears to be capable of triggering a cascade of events culminating in the\\nmultiorgan system dysfunction observed in preeclampsia. However, the \\nmechanism of endothelial\\ninjury remains speculative. In one theory, decreased placental oxygenation triggers the placenta to\\nrelease an unknown factor into the maternal circulation. This circulating factor is capable of damaging\\nor altering the function of maternal endothelial cells and triggering the cascade of events described. In\\nsupport of this theory, cultured trophoblasts exposed to a hypoxic environment release a variety of\\npotentially vaso-active factors, including thromboxane, interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor.\\nMoreover, serum from preeclamptic women, when applied to human endothelial cell cultures, alters\\nthe release of a variety of procoagulant, vasoactive, and mitogenic factors, including endothelin, nitric\\noxide, and prostacyclin. Serum from the same woman 6 weeks after delivery does not produce this\\neffect. Likewise, serum from a nonpreeclamptic woman at the same gestational age fails to trigger\\nthese endothelial changes. In many cases, reduced placental oxygenation may be explained by\\nmaternal vasculopathy (chronic hypertension, renal disease, collagen vascular disease) and in others\\nby abnormal placental mass (multiple gestation, diabetes, hydatidiform mole). In another subset of\\npatients, reduced placental oxygenation late in pregnancy may be the result of abnormal endovascular\\ntrophoblast invasion early in pregnancy. In the first trimester of a normal pregnancy, proliferating\\ntrophoblast invades the decidual segments of the maternal spiral arteries, replacing endothelium and\\ndestroying the medial elastic and muscular tissue of the arterial wall. The arterial wall is replaced by\\nfibrinoid material. During the second trimester, a second wave of endovascular trophoblastic invasion\\nextends down the lumen of the spiral arteries deeper in the myometrium. The endothelium and\\nmusculoelastic architecture of the spiral arteries are destroyed, resulting in dilated, thin-walled,\\nfunnel-shaped vessels that are passive conduits of the increased uteroplacental blood flow of\\npregnancy. In some women destined to develop preeclampsia, the first wave of endovascular\\ntrophoblastic invasion may be incomplete, and the second wave does not occur. As a result, the deeper\\nsegments of the spiral arteries are not remodeled but instead retain their musculoelastic architecture\\nand their ability to respond to endogenous vasoconstrictors, reducing maternal perfusion of the\\nplacenta and predisposing to relative placental hypoxia later in pregnancy. In addition, myometrial\\nportions of the spiral arteries exhibit a unique abnormality characterized by vessel wall damage,\\nfibrinoid necrosis, lipid deposition, and macrophage and mononuclear cell infiltration of vessel walls\\nand surrounding tissues. These changes, histologically similar to those observed in atherosclerosis, are\\nreferred to as acute atherosis and may lead to vascular lumen obliteration and placental infarction.\\nImportantly, these changes are attributed to abnormal endovascular trophoblastic invasion during the\\nsecond trimester of pregnancy, predisposing the fetus to suboptimal placental perfusion early in\\ngestation. Interestingly, the clinical manifestations are observed most often in the third trimester,\\npossibly due to increasing fetal and placental oxygen demands with advancing gestation.\\nThe reason that endovascular trophoblastic invasion progresses normally in most pregnancies but\\nabnormally in others is unclear. One theory maintains that maternal antibodies directed against\\npaternal antigens on invading trophoblasts are necessary to shield those antigens from recognition by\\ndecidual natural killer cells, protecting the invading trophoblast from attack and rejection by the\\ncellular arm of the maternal immune system. Supporting this theory is the observation that\\npreeclampsia appears to be associated with primi-paternity and the presumed lack of previous\\nmaternal exposure and sensitization to paternal trophoblast antigens in a previous pregnancy.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Additional support for this theory is provided by the observation that preeclampsia is more common\\namong women using barrier contraception than among those using nonbarrier forms of contraception\\nbefore pregnancy. This suggests that maternal exposure (and presumably sensitization) to paternal\\nantigens on sperm is protective against preeclampsia. The observed inverse relationship between\\nduration of cohabitation before pregnancy and the incidence of preeclampsia provides further\\nevidence that maternal sensitization to paternal antigens is protective against preeclampsia. The\\ninterplay between immunology and genetics is underscored by the observation that preeclampsia may\\nbe more common in pregnancies in which the father was the product of a preeclamptic pregnancy.\\nApplied to the theory under discussion, this suggests that some genetically determined paternal\\nantigens are less antigenic than others and therefore less likely to provoke an antibody response in an\\nexposed mother, decreasing maternal production of “blocking” antibodies and increasing the\\nlikelihood of abnormal placental invasion and preeclampsia. Alternatively, paternally inherited genes\\nmay code for altered fetal production of insulin-like growth factor-2, an insulin homologue related to\\nplacental invasion. Other genes that may be inherited from the father and play a role in the\\ndevelopment of preeclampsia include genes coding for angiotensinogen, methylenetetrahydrofolate\\nreductase, and the factor V Leiden mutation.\\nSome studies have demonstrated that invading trophoblastic cells in normal pregnancy undergo an\\n“antigenic shift” to resemble vascular endothelial antigens, masking them from recognition and\\nrejection by decidual natural killer cells. Invading trophoblasts in preeclamptic pregnancies may fail\\nto make this antigenic shift, exposing them to recognition by natural killer cells and halting normal\\ninvasion.\\nRecent work has demonstrated that soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) is increased in the\\nplacenta and serum of women with preeclampsia. This protein adheres to placental growth factor and\\nvascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), preventing their interaction with endothelial receptors and\\ncausing endothelial dysfunction. Interrupted angiogenesis may contribute to faulty placental invasion\\nearly in pregnancy and subsequent risk for placental \\nhypoxia–ischemia and preeclampsia. Unbound\\nplacental growth factor and VEGF have been found in decreased concentration during and even before\\nthe development of clinical preeclampsia.\\nGenetic, immunologic, and other factors govern the complex interaction between the maternal host\\nand the invading trophoblast. Detailed discussion of these and other possible etiologies of the entity of\\npreeclampsia are beyond the scope of this chapter. Regardless of the etiology, thorough familiarity\\nwith the clinical aspects of the disorder can help guide thoughtful and coherent management.\\nPreeclampsia exerts an effect on many different maternal organ systems:\\nA.

Cerebral edema may be\\nobserved. Head computed tomographic findings include focal white matter hypodensities in the\\nposterior cerebral hemispheres, temporal lobes, and brain stem, possibly reflecting petechial\\nhemorrhage with resultant local edema. Magnetic resonance imaging may reveal occipital and parietal\\nabnormalities in the watershed distribution of the major cerebral arteries, as well as lesions in the\\nbrain stem and basal ganglia. Subarachnoid or intraventricular hemorrhage may occur in severe cases.\\nB.

These divergent\\nobservations underscore the complexity of the disorder.\\nC. Lungs\\nAlterations in colloid oncotic pressure, capillary endothelial integrity, and intravascular hydrostatic\\npressure in preeclampsia predispose to noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. In women with\\npreeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension, preexisting hypertensive cardiac disease may\\nexacerbate the situation, superimposing cardiogenic pulmonary edema on noncardiogenic,\\npreeclampsia-related pulmonary edema. Excessive administration of intravenous (IV) fluid and\\npostpartum mobilization of accumulated extravascular fluid also increase the risk of pulmonary\\nedema. In eclampsia, pulmonary injury may result from aspiration of gastric contents, leading to\\npneumonia, pneumonitis, or adult respiratory distress syndrome.\\nD. Liver\\nHistologic lesions in the liver are characterized by sinusoidal fibrin deposition in the periportal areas\\nwith surrounding hemorrhage and portal capillary thrombi. Centrilobular necrosis may result from\\nreduced perfusion. Inflammation is not characteristic. Subcapsular hematomas may develop.

In the past, the classic diagnostic triad included hypertension, proteinuria,\\nand edema. Recently, the National High Blood Pressure Education Working Group recommended\\neliminating edema as a diagnostic criterion because it is too frequent an observation during normal\\npregnancy to be useful in diagnosing preeclampsia.

Eclampsia is defined as one or more generalized convulsions in\\nthe setting of preeclampsia.\\nTreatment\\nIn the management of preeclampsia, with few exceptions, maternal interests are best served by\\nimmediate delivery. However, this approach may not be in the best interest of the fetus. In the case of\\nextreme prematurity, for example, the fetus may benefit from a period of expectant management\\nduring which corticosteroids are administered to accelerate fetal maturation. The decision to proceed\\nwith immediate delivery versus expectant management is based on several factors, including disease\\nseverity, fetal maturity, maternal and fetal condition, and cervical status.\\nA.

Corticosteroids are\\nadministered if the gestational age is <34 weeks; amniocentesis is performed as needed to assess fetal\\npulmonary maturity.

Occasionally, outpatient management is reasonable in carefully\\nselected, reliable, asymptomatic patients with minimal proteinuria and normal laboratory test results.\\nThis approach includes bed rest at home, daily fetal movement counts, twice-weekly antepartum\\ntesting, serial evaluation of fetal growth, and frequent assessment, often by a visiting nurse, of blood\\npressure, proteinuria, weight gain, patellar reflexes, and symptoms. Any evidence of disease\\nprogression constitutes an indication for hospitalization and consideration of delivery. The benefit of\\nprophylactic intrapartum magnesium sulfate in preventing convulsions in patients with mild\\npreeclampsia has not been demonstrated conclusively in the literature.\\nB. Severe Preeclampsia\\nSevere preeclampsia mandates hospitalization. Delivery is indicated if the gestational age is 34 weeks\\nor greater, fetal pulmonary maturity is confirmed, or evidence of deteriorating maternal or fetal status\\nis seen. Acute blood pressure control may be achieved with hydralazine, labetalol, or nifedipine. The\\ngoal of antihypertensive therapy is to achieve a systolic blood pressure <160 mm Hg and a diastolic\\nblood pressure <105 mm Hg. Overly aggressive control of the blood pressure may compromise\\nmaternal perfusion of the intervillous space and adversely affect fetal oxygenation. Hydralazine is a\\nperipheral vasodilator that can be given in doses of 5–10 mg administered intravenously (IV). The\\nonset of action is 10–20 minutes, and the dose can be repeated in 20–30 minutes if necessary.\\nLabetalol can be administered in doses of 5–20 mg by slow IV push. The dose can be repeated in 10–\\n20 minutes. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that can be used in doses of 5–10 mg orally. The\\nsublingual route of administration should not be used. The dose can be repeated in 20–30 minutes, as\\nneeded.\\nManagement of severe preeclampsia before 34 weeks is controversial. In some institutions,\\ndelivery is accomplished regardless of fetal maturity. In others, delivery is delayed for a limited\\nperiod of time to permit the administration of corticosteroids. Four large randomized controlled trials\\ncomparing magnesium sulfate with other methods of treatment to prevent convulsions in women with\\nsevere preeclampsia have demonstrated that magnesium sulfate is associated with a significantly\\nlower rate of eclampsia than either no treatment or nimodipine. Lucas and colleagues reported no\\nseizures among 1049 preeclamptic women receiving magnesium sulfate prophylaxis. Nonetheless,\\ntonic–clonic convulsions may occur despite magnesium sulfate therapy. Magnesium sulfate is\\ninitiated, fetal status is monitored continuously, and antihypertensive agents are used as needed to\\nmaintain a systolic blood pressure <160 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure <105 mm Hg.

Intrapartum Management of Preeclampsia\\nIn women with preeclampsia without contraindications to labor, vaginal delivery is the preferred\\napproach. Cervical ripening agents and oxytocin are used as needed. If magnesium sulfate is used for\\nseizure prophylaxis, it is administered as an IV loading dose of 4–6 g over 20–60 minutes, followed by\\na maintenance dose of 1–2 g/h. Urine output and serum creatinine level are monitored, and the\\nmagnesium dose is adjusted accordingly to prevent hypermagnesemia. Patellar reflexes and\\nrespiratory rate should be assessed frequently. In the presence of patellar reflexes, serum magnesium\\nlevels usually are unnecessary. Therapeutic magnesium levels range from 4–8 mg/dL. Loss of patellar\\nreflexes is observed at magnesium levels of 10 mg/dL or higher, respiratory paralysis may occur at\\nlevels of 15 mg/dL or above, and cardiac arrest is possible with levels in excess of 25 mg/dL. Calcium\\ngluconate (10 mL of 10% solution) should be available in the event of hypermagnesemia. To avoid\\npulmonary edema, total IV fluids should not exceed 100 mL/h. Pain control is achieved with regional\\nanesthesia or with intramuscular or IV narcotic analgesics. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is\\nreserved for refractory pulmonary edema, adult respiratory distress syndrome, or oliguria\\nunresponsive to fluid challenge.

The first priorities are to ensure\\nthat the airway is clear and to prevent injury and aspiration of gastric contents. Diazepam or\\nlorazepam should be used only if seizures are sustained. Nearly all tonic–clonic seizures are\\naccompanied by a prolonged fetal heart rate deceleration that resolves after the seizure has ended.\\nOnce the patient has been stabilized, delivery is indicated. If possible, a 10- to 20-minute period of in\\nutero resuscitation should be permitted before delivery. Convulsions alone do not constitute an\\nindication for caesarean section. However, if vaginal birth is not possible within a reasonable period\\nof time, caesarean delivery is performed in most cases.

These alterations may stress the maternal cardiovascular system, leading to signs\\nand symptoms similar to those seen in heart disease. Women with preexisting cardiovascular disease\\nare particularly at risk, as they may exhibit marked clinical deterioration during the course of\\npregnancy.\\nBlood volume begins to increase as early as 6 weeks of gestation and continues to rise until\\nmidpregnancy. The hormonally mediated increase in plasma volume is disproportionately higher than\\nthe red cell mass, resulting in the so-called physiologic anemia of pregnancy. Cardiac output (CO) is\\nincreased by 50% above the nonpregnant state as a product of increased stroke volume, along with an\\nincreased heart rate by 10–20 beats/min. CO peaks in the mid-second trimester and plateaus\\nthereafter. Myocardial contractility improves, left atrial and left ventricular chamber sizes increase,\\nand peripheral vascular resistance falls (effects of progesterone, circulating prostaglandins, atrial\\nnatriuretic peptides, endothelial nitric oxide, and the low-resistance vascular bed of the placenta). The\\nsystemic arterial pressure falls during the first trimester, remains stable during the second trimester,\\nand returns to pregestational levels before term. The reduction in diastolic pressure is more\\npronounced than the reduction in systolic pressure, leading to a wide pulse pressure. Supine\\nhypotensive or uterocaval syndrome may occur in 0.5–11% of pregnancies and is related to the acute\\nocclusion of inferior vena cava by the gravid uterus in the supine position; it is characterized by\\nsignificant decreases in blood pressure and heart rate. This contrasts with the tachycardia seen with\\nhypotension in the nonpregnant state. Patients usually complain of lightheadedness, nausea, dizziness,\\nand syncope in extreme cases. Symptoms are alleviated by changing to a left lateral recumbent\\nposition.\\nHemodynamic changes during labor and delivery are in part related to the fear, anxiety, and pain\\nexperienced by the patient at that stage. Additionally, uterine contractions displace 300–500 mL of\\nblood with each contraction, further augmenting CO. Oxygen consumption increases 3-fold. These\\nchanges in CO are less pronounced if the patient remains in the supine position with leftward tilt and\\nreceives adequate analgesia. Immediately after delivery, relief of caval compression coupled with\\nautotransfusion from the contracting uterus produces a further increase in CO. This may lead to acute\\ncardiac decompensation in the immediate postpartum period. Most of these physiologic changes\\nrevert to prepregnancy levels by 2 weeks postpartum.\\nHEART DISEASE\\nHeart disease is surpassing other causes of maternal mortality in recent years.

As the general\\npopulation becomes more susceptible to diabetes mellitus, morbid obesity, and hypertension, more\\nfrequent encounters with ischemic heart disease in pregnant patients are expected.\\nCARDIOVASCULAR EVALUATION DURING PREGNANCY\\nMost women with heart disease have successful pregnancies, but complacency in the diagnosis and\\nmanagement of pregnant patients can have direct consequences for both the mother and the fetus.\\nTherefore, it is essential to evaluate every pregnant woman with heart disease for her risk of adverse\\noutcomes during pregnancy, labor, delivery, and postpartum. In general, all such women should be\\nreferred to a tertiary care center for a multidisciplinary management by an obstetrician, cardiologist,\\nclinical geneticist, and neonatologist.\\nPreconception Counseling\\nCare of women with cardiac disease should ideally begin with preconception counseling. Certain\\nconditions may need treatment before attempting pregnancy. Cardiac conditions associated with high\\nmaternal mortality include pulmonary hypertension (primary and secondary), peripartum and other\\ncardiomyopathies with reduced ejection fraction, Marfan’s syndrome with aortic root enlargement,\\nand complicated coarctation of aorta (\\nTable 27–2\\n).

Rheumatic heart\\ndisease develops after a group A β-hemolytic streptococcal infection of the upper airway. Even though\\nits incidence in developing countries has declined as a result of the prevalent use of antibiotics,\\nrheumatic valvular disease still afflicts a large majority of women of childbearing age in Asia, Central\\nAmerica, and South America.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe characteristic findings include a right ventricular lift, a loud first heart sound (S\\n1\\n), an accentuated\\npulmonic component of the second heart sound (P\\n2\\n), an opening snap, and a low-frequency diastolic\\nrumble at the apex with presystolic accentuation (if the patient is in sinus rhythm). The murmur is\\nbest heard with the bell of the stethoscope in the left lateral decubitus position. The electrocardiogram\\noften is normal but may indicate left atrial enlargement, right-axis deviation, or even right ventricular\\nhypertrophy. Echocardiogram is diagnostic.\\nComplications\\nThe increased left atrial pressure may predispose the patient to atrial arrhythmias (ie, atrial\\nfibrillation). This new-onset atrial fibrillation can precipitate acute decompensation even in the setting\\nof mild to moderate MS due to acceleration of ventricular rate that decreases the diastolic filling\\nperiod and thus increases pulmonary venous pressure. The pregnant cardiac patient also is at risk for\\ndeveloping thromboembolic complications in a setting of existing hypercoagulable state as well as\\nvenous stasis in the legs.\\nTreatment\\nThe goals are to prevent/treat tachycardia and atrial fibrillation, prevent fluid overload, and alleviate\\npain and anxiety. Beta blockers, diuretics, and occasionally digitalis and anticoagulants may be\\nnecessary to treat congestive failure and atrial arrhythmias. Patients with chronic atrial fibrillation\\nshould be anticoagulated with subcutaneous heparin. Anemia, infection, and thyrotoxicosis should be\\ncorrected. Large fluctuations in hemodynamics due to venous pooling in the legs should be prevented\\nby the use of elastic support hose, especially late in pregnancy.

The most\\ncommon cause of MR is mitral valve prolapse, which is seen in approximately 50% of cases of MR.\\nWith mitral valve prolapse, there is myxomatous degeneration of the valve, which causes stretching\\nout of the valve and chordae tendineae.

Systemic hypertension may lead to an increase in left to right shunt, which may lead to\\npulmonary volume overload/CHF similar to that seen in ASD and VSD physiology.\\nE. Eisenmenger’s Syndrome\\nEisenmenger’s syndrome is the reversal of a left to right shunt (ASD, VSD, PDA) due to progressive\\npulmonary hypertension. Right to left shunting leads to systemic arterial oxygen desaturation and\\ncentral cyanosis. The degree of cyanosis is determined by the extent of pulmonary vascular\\nobstructive disease. Maternal mortality approaches 30–50% and fetal loss may be as high as 75%. It is\\none of the few conditions in which pregnancy is contraindicated. If the patient is seen for the first time\\nearly in pregnancy, she should strongly be advised to terminate pregnancy. Various pulmonary\\nvasodilators have been successfully used in pregnancy to lower the pulmonary pressures, but the\\noverall prognosis remains grim. In these patients, the pulmonary pressures may reach systemic levels,\\nand therefore, a minimal lowering of systemic blood pressure may cause massive right to left\\nshunting. This may lead to worsening hypoxia, setting up a vicious cycle of further pulmonary\\nvasoconstriction, and may result in rapid hemodynamic deterioration. Therefore, continuous pulse\\noximetry and oxygen administration to keep oxygen saturations above 90% is beneficial.

In addition to the more ominous cardiovascular complications, obstetrical morbidities,\\nincluding uterine inversion, postpartum hemorrhage, and rectovaginal perforation, have been reported.\\nPERIPARTUM CARDIOMYOPATHY\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown cause.\\n It usually is diagnosed during late pregnancy or in the 4–5 months after delivery.\\n It is diagnosed with the finding of left ventricular systolic dysfunction in a woman with no history\\nof cardiac disease.\\nPathogenesis\\nAt present, the etiology of peripartum cardiomyopathy is unclear. A number of pathophysiologic\\nmechanisms have been proposed, including inflammation, myocarditis, an abnormal maternal\\nimmunologic response to fetal antigens, and other environmental factors. A single clear cause,\\nhowever, has not been identified.\\nClinical Findings\\nPatients usually present with dyspnea, cough, chest discomfort, or fatigue. The diagnosis is based on\\nthe following criteria:\\n• Presentation with heart failure during the last month of pregnancy or within 5 months postpartum\\n• Absence of an underlying cause for the heart failure\\n• No history of heart disease before presentation\\n• Evidence of left ventricular systolic dysfunction by an ejection fraction <45% or reduced shortening\\nfraction\\nEchocardiogram typically reveals a reduction in cardiac contractility and dilation of the left\\nventricle without hypertrophy. Serial B-type natriuretic peptide levels may be a useful marker to\\nfollow through the pregnancy.\\nComplications\\nPatients with ejection fraction of <35% are at risk or thromboembolism; therefore, prophylactic'),\n",

Principles of therapy are similar to that in the nonpregnant state, including supportive care\\n(consisting of bed rest and fluid and salt restriction) and medical therapy. Medical therapy includes\\ndiuretics, vasodilators, and digitalis with or without beta-blockers. The use of angiotensin-converting\\nenzyme inhibitors is contraindicated during pregnancy.\\nPrognosis\\nCardiac function normalizes within 6 months of delivery in approximately half of patients with\\nperipartum cardiomyopathy. Long-term outcomes of patients with previous history of peripartum\\ncardiomyopathy is related to recovery of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Patients with\\nrecovered LVEF have a 20% risk of developing heart failure during future pregnancy. On the other\\nhand, patients with persistent left ventricular dysfunction have a 30% risk of congestive heart failure\\nand 17% risk of maternal mortality in their subsequent pregnancy. There is considerable controversy\\nregarding the safety of subsequent pregnancy in patients with a history of peripartum cardiomyopathy\\nand normalization of left ventricular function. It is recognized that left ventricular systolic function\\nmay decline with the subsequent pregnancy, even in patients who had normalization after the prior\\npregnancy. Careful prepregnancy counseling and discussion about the risks, including the potential for\\nlife-threatening complications, should be outlined with the patient and partner before proceeding with\\na subsequent pregnancy.\\nPREGNANCY AFTER PROSTHETIC HEART VALVE REPLACEMENT\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n Patients with prosthetic heart valve are particularly at risk during pregnancy due to difficulties in\\nmaintaining adequate and consistent levels of anticoagulation.\\nPathogenesis\\nMany women with a history of valvular heart disease may have undergone prosthetic valve\\nreplacement before pregnancy, either with mechanical or bioprosthetic valves. The use of\\nbioprosthetic/tissue valve obviates the need for anticoagulants, but the life span of bioprosthetic\\nvalves is only 8–10 years, and anticoagulation may still be required if the patient is in atrial\\nfibrillation. Compared with mechanical valves, the high rate of bioprosthetic valve deterioration is\\nprimarily determined by the younger age group (ie, childbearing years ([29% vs. 82%]). Recent\\nstudies report no impact of pregnancy on the overall bioprosthetic valve longevity. The majority of\\npregnant women have mechanical prosthesis in place these days.\\nComplications\\nWomen with prosthetic valves during pregnancy are at risk of a number of complications, including\\nvalve failure, heart failure, thromboembolism, bleeding related to anticoagulation, and infection.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Treatment\\nManagement of women with mechanical valves involves careful therapeutic anticoagulation. The\\noptions include oral anticoagulation with warfarin, unfractionated heparin, and low-molecular-weight\\nheparin. Use of warfarin in the first trimester of pregnancy carries the risk of teratogenicity, as it\\ncrosses the placental barrier and can affect fetal cartilage and bone development. Warfarin in doses <5\\nmg/day has significantly lower risk of fetal complications. As warfarin crosses the placental barrier, it\\nmay cause fetal anticoagulation with risk of intracranial bleeding at the time of delivery. Therefore,\\nwarfarin is not a preferred agent toward the end of pregnancy, and patients are generally switched to a\\nheparin preparation at 36 weeks of gestation. Unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight\\nheparin do not cross the placental barrier and have no teratogenic threat to the fetus. Three regimens\\nfor anticoagulation during pregnancy are heparin throughout the pregnancy, warfarin throughout the\\npregnancy, or a combination of both drugs using heparin during the first trimester to minimize the\\npossible teratogenic effect of warfarin, switching to warfarin in the late first trimester, then switching\\nback to heparin in the late third trimester in anticipation of delivery in order to minimize fetal\\nanticoagulation. There is considerable controversy regarding the best approach to the patient who\\nrequires anticoagulation for a mechanical heart valve during pregnancy.

The risk of aspiration of gastric contents is increased during pregnancy due to elevated\\nintraabdominal pressure, decreased gastroesophageal sphincter tone, delayed gastric emptying, and\\ndiminished laryngeal reflexes. Aspiration may be the result of passive regurgitation or active\\nvomiting. Aspiration was reported to account for 30–50% of maternal deaths related to anesthetic\\ncomplications, and if bacterial infection after aspiration occurred, usually after 24–72 hours, the\\nmortality rate could be even higher. Due to advances in obstetric—and particularly anesthetic—\\nmanagement, the incidence of aspiration pneumonitis and its complications has been considerably\\nreduced. Aspiration pneumonitis has also been called Mendelson’s syndrome, named after the\\nphysician who described a large series of women with this complication in association with aspiration\\nat time of operative intervention.\\nPrevention'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Given the high risk associated with aspiration pneumonitis, including the possibility of maternal\\ndeath, every effort should be made to prevent this potentially catastrophic condition. General\\nanesthesia is the main risk factor related to aspiration, and expert airway management during\\ninduction and intubation is extremely important.\\nOral intake during labor is not generally recommended. Women undergoing elective caesarean\\ndelivery should not be given anything by mouth for at least 6–8 hours before the procedure. All\\nanesthetized obstetric patients should be intubated. Laryngeal reflexes will generally prevent\\naspiration while patients are awake, but the reflexes will be altered in patients who are given excessive\\nsedation, in patients who are under anesthesia, or in patients with seizures. Pain, anxiety, narcotics,\\nand labor itself may cause delayed gastric emptying and increased intragastric pressure. Lowering the\\nvolume of gastric contents to <25 mL and raising the gastric pH to >2.5 will reduce the risk of\\npulmonary injury if aspiration occurs. Clear, nonparticulate systemic alkalizers (eg, sodium citrate-\\nBacitra, or Alka-Seltzer) must be used instead of particulate oral antacids (eg, magnesium trisilicate,\\nMaalox, Riopan). Thirty milliliters of a clear antacid should be routinely given to all women 30\\nminutes before induction of anesthesia.\\nGastric acidity may also be reduced by histamine-2 (H\\n2\\n) receptor blockers. Cimetidine and\\nranitidine have been reported to be safe for use during pregnancy. Metoclopramide may increase\\nlower esophageal sphincter tone and enhance gastric emptying. However, antacids are preferred,\\nparticularly in emergency situations, because they are reliable and fast acting. H\\n2\\n blockers and\\nmetoclopramide are not recommended for routine use.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe pathologic mechanism, clinical manifestations, and outcome depend on the volume (≥25 mL),\\nacidity (pH ≤2.5), and composition (presence or absence of solid particles) of the aspirate. Small\\nvolumes of a very acidic aspirate will be highly toxic, whereas relatively large volumes of a buffered\\naspirate can be relatively well tolerated. Aspiration of large, solid particulate matter may occlude\\nportions of the larger bronchi, resulting in hypoxia, pulmonary hypertension, and even death. With\\nsmaller particles, bronchial obstruction occurs more distally, resulting in atelectasis, hypoxia, and\\ninflammation of the bronchial mucosal and respiratory distress. Symptoms immediately after\\naspiration include dyspnea, bronchospasm, cyanosis, tachycardia, and even respiratory arrest. The\\npatient will be hypoxic, hypercapnic, and acidotic.

The localization of the chest X Ray abnormalities will depend on the\\npatient’s position when the aspiration occurred: a) at the lung bases if she was upright, b) in the upper\\nlobes or in the superior segment of the lower lobes if she was supine. A picture of diffuse interstitial\\npulmonary edema (“white out”) may be seen after aspiration of large amounts of very acidic material.\\nTreatment\\nIf aspiration occurs during anesthesia, immediate intubation and suction should be performed,\\nfollowed by ventilation and adequate oxygenation. Positive end-expiratory pressure may help to better\\nexpand areas of fluid-filled collapsed lung. Bronchoscopic suction should be performed as soon as\\npossible if the aspirate contains solid particles. A chest x-ray film should be taken and serial blood gas\\ndeterminations made.

Recent studies report that asthma occurs in\\nup to 9% of the general US population and in 3.7–8.4% of pregnant women. Therefore, asthma has\\nbecome one of the most common medical illnesses complicating pregnancy. The increased prevalence\\nis reported worldwide, particularly in urban areas, and is generally attributed to industrial pollution.\\nHowever, marked geographic variations occur, and the extent to which genetic predisposition plays a\\nrole is still under active investigation.\\nCommon triggers of asthma include upper respiratory infections (more commonly viral);\\nadministration of beta-blockers, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; sulfites and other\\nfood preservatives; allergens such as pollen, animal dander, mites, or molds; smoking; gastric reflux;\\nand exercise or other causes of hyperventilation. Both cigarette smoking and other major\\nenvironmental pollutants are specifically associated with fetal damage.\\nChildhood-onset asthma affects males more often than females. In contrast, adult-onset asthma\\nreportedly occurs more frequently in women. Overall, the prevalence and severity of asthma are'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='consistently reported to be greater in women than in men. Women also are reported to require more\\nfrequent emergency room visits and more hospitalizations. Therefore, sex hormones are believed to\\nplay a role in the differences observed in the occurrence of asthma, although the exact mechanisms are\\nnot completely understood. Asthma shows variations during the menstrual cycle, with premenstrual\\nexacerbation more often reported. Reports on asthma during the menopause are more conflicting, with\\nsome studies noting improvement but others reporting more episodes of bronchospasm after 6 months\\nof hormone replacement therapy.\\nNo consistent effect (either worsening or improvement) during pregnancy has been observed,\\nalthough one-third of women with more severe disease reportedly became worse late in the second\\ntrimester or early in the third trimester. Possible factors contributing to improvement include the\\nhigher levels of cortisol (anti-inflammatory) and progesterone (smooth muscle relaxant) and for\\nworsening the higher (5–6 times) rate of sinusitis and gastroesophageal reflux during pregnancy.\\nOthers speculate that pregnancy does not have an effect on asthma and that the variations observed are\\nsimply part of the natural history of the disease or due to variable medication compliance when\\nwomen find out that they are pregnant. Some become more compliant and their asthma improves, and\\nothers stop their medication, fearing for the fetus, and their disease worsens. The responses in\\nsubsequent pregnancies are somewhat more consistent and in 60% of women tend to be similar to\\nthose that occurred during the first pregnancy.\\nClinical Findings\\nA diagnosis of asthma is usually made on clinical grounds and without much difficulty if an adequate\\nhistory and physical examination are obtained. Most patients are diagnosed with asthma before\\npregnancy and already are receiving treatment. Symptoms suggestive of asthma include cough,\\ndyspnea, chest tightness, and wheezing, particularly when episodes occur episodically. Pulmonary\\nfunction studies are useful to confirm the diagnosis and should be part of the initial investigation and\\nsurveillance of disease. The forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV\\n1\\n)/forced vital capacity (FVC)\\nratio will be <70%, and the airway obstruction can be reversed by administration of a short-acting\\nbeta\\n2\\n-agonist preparations.\\nAsthma currently is classified according to severity as (1) mild intermittent, (2) mild persistent, (3)\\nmoderate persistent, and (4) severe persistent. In mild intermittent asthma, symptoms do not occur\\nmore often than twice per week, and nocturnal symptoms do not occur more often than twice per\\nmonth. The peak expiratory flow (PEF) or the FEV\\n1\\n is >80% of normal, with <20% variability. In\\nmild persistent asthma, symptoms occur more often than twice per week but not daily, and nocturnal\\nsymptoms occur more often than twice per month. The PEF or FEV\\n1\\n still is at least 80% of normal,\\nbut with greater (20–30%) variability. In moderate persistent asthma, symptoms occur daily, and\\nnocturnal symptoms occur more than once per week. The PEF or FEV\\n1\\n is <80% but >60% of normal,\\nwith >30% variability. In severe persistent asthma, daytime symptoms occur continually, and\\nnocturnal attacks occur frequently. The PEF or FEV\\n1\\n is <60% of normal, with >30% variability.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nRarely, bronchospasm is caused by a condition other than asthma. These conditions include acute left\\nventricular heart failure (also called \\ncardiac asthma\\n), pulmonary embolism, exacerbation of chronic\\nbronchitis, carcinoid tumors, upper airway obstruction (laryngeal edema, foreign body),\\ngastroesophageal reflux, and cough caused by some medications.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Complications\\nPotential maternal complications include hyperemesis gravidarum, pneumonia (women with asthma\\naccount for >60% of pneumonia cases in pregnancy), preeclampsia, vaginal bleeding, more\\ncomplicated labors, and more caesarean deliveries. Fetal complications can include intrauterine\\ngrowth restriction, preterm birth, low birth weight, neonatal hypoxia, and increased overall perinatal\\nmortality. Women with severe asthma are at the highest risk. However, patients are at little or no\\nincreased risk when the disease is effectively treated and controlled.\\nTreatment\\nA. General Measures\\nThe main goal of therapy is to maintain normal or near normal maternal pulmonary function to allow\\nadequate fetal oxygenation, prevent exacerbations, and allow the patient to maintain her usual\\nactivities. In general, pregnant women are receptive to educational interventions that will improve\\ntheir asthma management, and the benefits are likely to continue after delivery. A good example is\\nlearning the proper use of portable peak flow meters to objectively evaluate asthma severity, because\\nclinical symptoms and the patient’s own perception of the severity of asthma often are inaccurate. The\\nPEF rate correlates well with FEV\\n1\\n and allows the detection of worsening at an early stage before\\nserious symptoms appear as well as the evaluation of response to treatment while the patient is still at\\nhome. Avoidance of potential asthma triggers also is extremely important. The general principles of\\nmanagement for pregnant asthmatic women are similar to those for nonpregnant patients and include\\nremoving pets if necessary, encasing mattresses and pillows in airtight covers, carefully washing the\\nbedding, keeping ambient humidity <50%, avoid vacuuming (or at least wear a mask), using air\\nconditioning and air filters, avoiding outdoor activities when allergens and air pollution levels are\\nhigh, and avoiding nonallergen irritants, such as strong odors, food additives, aspirin, beta-blockers,\\nand particularly tobacco smoke. Several recent studies have shown that these measures not only are\\nbeneficial, but are cost-effective as well. Every effort should be made to achieve smoking cessation\\nduring pregnancy, which is a very serious but modifiable factor associated with adverse outcome.\\nPatients undergoing immunotherapy may continue doing so during pregnancy but without any\\nfurther dose increase. Starting immunotherapy de novo during pregnancy is not recommended because\\nuterine contractions are likely to develop if anaphylaxis occurs.\\nInfluenza vaccination is currently recommended for all pregnant women during the flu season. This\\nrecommendation is of the utmost importance for pregnant women with asthma. Asthma sufferers also\\nshould receive the pneumococcal vaccine but preferably before pregnancy.\\nTreating rhinitis and sinusitis, which often are associated with asthma and may trigger\\nexacerbations, is important. Treatment of rhinitis includes reducing exposure to antigens\\n(environmental control); intranasal cromolyn sodium, antihistamines (tripelennamine or\\nchlorpheniramine), and intranasal steroids are very beneficial. For treatment of sinusitis, amoxicillin\\n(erythromycin if allergic to penicillin), oxymetazoline (nasal spray or drops), and pseudoephedrine are\\nmore often used.\\nB. Pharmacologic Therapy\\nMany women have the impression that most, if not all, medications might be harmful to the fetus.\\nHowever, they should be informed that the risk of uncontrolled asthma is far worse than any of the\\npotential side effects of the most common medications used to treat asthma. Most women with asthma\\ncan be managed effectively during pregnancy, and complications are generally confined to patients'),\n",

When symptoms occur,\\n2 puffs of a short-acting beta\\n2\\n agonist can be used as needed. More data are available for use of\\nalbuterol than for any other beta\\n2\\n agonist during pregnancy, and no harm to the fetus has been\\nobserved to date. These women may still experience severe exacerbations, which may be separated by\\nlong asymptomatic periods, and a short course of systemic corticosteroids may be needed.\\n2. Mild persistent asthma\\n—The preferred therapy for this group of patients is a low-dose inhaled\\ncorticosteroid. More experience is available for budesonide use in pregnancy, and the published data\\nregarding its safety and lack of risk for congenital anomalies are reassuring. Less experience is\\nreported with beclomethasone, but the published data also are reassuring. Inhaled corticosteroids\\nsuppress and may even prevent airway inflammation, which plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of\\nasthma and may decrease airway responsiveness as well. Because they may decrease and sometimes\\neven obviate the need for systemic steroids, their use is now recommended at earlier stages of asthma.\\nHowever, the full benefits may not be seen for 2–4 weeks, so they are not recommended as part of the\\ntreatment of acute attacks. Use of a mouth spacer to minimize systemic absorption is strongly\\nrecommended. Inhaled corticosteroids are likewise beneficial for rhinitis (2 sprays in each nostril\\ntwice daily).\\nAlternative, but not preferred, therapies for this group include inhaled cromolyn sodium,\\nleukotriene receptor antagonists, or sustained-release theophylline. Cromolyn sodium is also anti-\\ninflammatory drug, but its efficacy is less predictable than that of the inhaled corticosteroids, and the\\nbenefits may not be seen for 4–6 weeks. Nevertheless, cromolyn sodium seems to be free of side\\neffects for mother or fetus. Few data on the use of leukotriene receptor modifiers during pregnancy are\\navailable; they are reported to be safe in animals, but human data are limited. The extensive\\nexperience with theophylline during pregnancy indicates that it is safe for the fetus except when\\nmaternal levels exceed 12 μ/mL. In these cases, the fetus or newborn may develop jitteriness,\\ntachycardia, and vomiting.\\n3. Moderate persistent asthma\\n—The preferred treatment is a combination of a low-dose or medium-\\ndose inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta\\n2\\n agonist. Alternative therapies (but again not\\npreferred) include a low-dose or medium-dose inhaled corticosteroid and either theophylline or a\\nleukotriene receptor antagonist. However, given the limited data on human pregnancy, the use of\\nleukotriene receptor modifiers is reserved for patients who showed a very good response before\\npregnancy but are not responding well to other medications while pregnant.\\n4. Severe persistent asthma\\n—The preferred treatment is a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid and a\\nlong-acting inhaled beta\\n2\\n agonist as well as (if needed) a systemic corticosteroid, such as 2 mg/kg/d of\\nprednisone or equivalent steroid not to exceed 60 mg/d, with an attempt to taper to the minimal\\neffective dose. An alternative, but not preferred, treatment includes a high-dose inhaled corticosteroid\\nand sustained-release theophylline (keeping maternal systemic levels at 5–12 μg/mL for the reasons\\nexplained previously).\\nThe US Food and Drug Administration has recently issued warnings about the use of long-acting\\nbeta-agonists (LABAs). A paradoxical increase in exacerbations in some patients, particularly in\\nchildren, has been reported mainly with LABA monotherapy.

They usually are given first as a short, rapidly tapering course (eg, 40–60 mg/d of prednisone\\nor equivalent steroid for 1 week, tapering off during the second week). If these courses fail to\\neffectively control symptoms for <2–3 weeks, long-term systemic corticosteroid treatment may be\\nneeded.

Pregnant women with asthma who are\\nsteroid dependent should be managed by an internist/pulmonologist who is experienced in the\\ntreatment of asthma during pregnancy.\\nC. Other Asthma Medications\\nNonselective beta agonists such as epinephrine and isoproterenol are sometimes given subcutaneously\\nduring acute asthma attacks. Epinephrine use during pregnancy should be avoided because epinephrine\\ncauses vasoconstriction and reduces fetal oxygenation. It is teratogenic in animals as well as in\\nhumans. Isoproterenol also is teratogenic in animals. Because many other alternative therapies are\\navailable, isoproterenol use in humans is best avoided. Iodine-containing medications should be\\navoided during pregnancy because the fetus may be at risk for developing a goiter, which may become\\nvery large and cause airway obstruction and even asphyxia. Nedocromil sodium is similar to cromolyn\\nsodium. No reports on humans are available, but nedocromil sodium has not been observed to be\\nteratogenic in animal experiments. Anticholinergic medications such as atropine (which block\\nbronchoconstriction by inhaled irritants) may accelerate the fetal heart rate and inhibit breathing.\\nIpratropium has not been reported to be teratogenic in animals, but data on humans are lacking.\\nGlycopyrrolate has been used safely in humans near term, and no defects have been reported in animal\\nexperiments.\\n1. Acute asthmatic attack\\n—During acute exacerbations, dyspnea, cough, wheezing, and chest\\ntightness increase and expiratory flow decreases. A few, well-educated patients with relatively mild\\nattacks might be managed at home, taking advantage of the judicious use of peak flow measurements.\\nHowever, any serious exacerbation most likely will require \\nhospitalization. Great care should be\\nexercised to maintain a maternal \\n and O\\n2\\n saturation >95%. A maternal \\nwill result in marked fetal hypoxia.\\nGeneral measures include reassuring the patient and avoiding sedatives, which may depress\\nrespiration. Oxygen can be administered by mask or nasal catheter with the goal of maintaining \\n and O\\n2\\n saturation >90% to ensure adequate fetal oxygenation at all times.

Since then, the number of reported cases declined\\nsteadily, until recently, when higher numbers are being identified. This situation is attributed to\\nincreased immigration from countries with a high tuberculosis prevalence and particularly to the\\nHIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) epidemic. Worldwide, TB is very prevalent, with\\n8 million new cases and 2 million deaths annually. Eighty percent of TB deaths in women occur\\nduring their childbearing years, and pregnant women are not spared from TB effects. Many of these\\nat-risk women will seek health care only when pregnant, thus providing an opportunity for diagnosis\\nand treatment.\\nTuberculosis in adults is mainly (>95%) a disease of the pulmonary parenchyma caused by\\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\\n, a nonmotile, acid-fast aerobic rod. Transmission usually occurs by\\ninhalation of droplets produced by infected individuals when coughing. The droplets can remain\\nsuspended in the air for prolonged periods (several hours). The persons most at risk for becoming\\ninfected are family members and other close contacts, such as coworkers and roommates (elderly\\nresidents and employees in long-term care facilities, correctional institutions), homeless individuals,\\nand intravenous drug users. After the initial inhalation, the bacilli multiply in the alveoli and\\nsubsequently spread to the regional lymph nodes and to other organs such as the upper lung regions,\\nkidneys, bones, central nervous system, and, rarely, during pregnancy, to the placenta. In most people,\\nthe infection is contained by cell-mediated immunity, which develops 2–10 weeks after exposure,\\nwhen the infected sites are walled off by granulomatous inflammation and the tuberculin tests then\\nbecomes reactive. At this stage, these persons are not infectious and are asymptomatic except for the\\npositive tuberculin skin test. After the initial exposure, the risk of developing active disease during the\\nfollowing 2–5 years is generally given as 5–15%, but the risk later falls to very low levels <1–2%.\\nHowever, active disease may ensue if a person is unable to contain the infection when first exposed or\\nif the person subsequently becomes immunocompromised and the infection is reactivated at a time\\nremote from the initial exposure.\\nClinical Findings\\nMost cases of tuberculosis can be diagnosed on the basis of a history of cough, weight loss, positive\\ntuberculin skin test, and chest x-ray film.\\nA. Symptoms and Signs\\nPrimary TB infection is usually asymptomatic, except in the rare instances when dissemination\\noccurs. Typical symptoms include cough, sometimes with hemoptysis, low-grade fever, weight loss,\\nfatigue, night sweats, and anorexia, although some patients may have few symptoms. In\\nextrapulmonary TB, the symptoms are related to the organ system involved.\\nB. Laboratory Findings\\nThe definitive diagnosis is made after positive identification of the bacilli by Ziehl-Neelsen staining\\nand a positive culture, usually from a sputum sample. At times, the sample for culture will be obtained\\nfrom the urine, other body fluid, or a body tissue. Although acid-fast bacilli can be identified on\\nstained slides, culture confirmation is required, which may take several weeks. Faster detection\\nmethods are currently under development.\\nC.

An induration of 10 mm or more is considered positive in persons who have\\nrisk factors other than HIV, such as diabetes mellitus, silicosis, chronic use of corticosteroids or other\\nimmunosuppressive drugs, cancer (solid tumors as well as leukemias and lymphomas), chronic renal\\ninsufficiency, gastrectomy or intestinal bypass, or malabsorption and chronic malnutrition with body\\nweight 10% or less below the ideal. Data are being accumulated on the effectiveness of other methods\\nthat could be used as an alternative to the skin test.\\nD. Chest X-Ray Film\\nWith the abdomen shielded and preferably after the first trimester, a chest x-ray film should be taken\\nin patients in whom skin testing is positive after an earlier negative test and in patients with a\\nsuggestive history or physical examination even though skin testing is negative. Findings suggestive\\nof TB include upper lobes or superior lower lobe segments’ nodular infiltrates that at times may\\nbecome cavitary. A calcified hilar node and an also calcified peripheral nodule (Ghon’s complex)\\nconstitute a healed primary lesion. A small number of patients may initially have a normal x-ray.\\nComplications\\nCongenital tuberculosis is rare, although cases of fetal infection have been reported. The infection\\nmay occur when the fetus swallows infected amniotic fluid or be bloodborne through the umbilical\\ncirculation. The criteria for diagnosis include positive bacteriologic studies occurring within the first\\nfew days of life with an exclusion of an extrauterine infection source, as more commonly\\ncontamination occurs after birth from an infected mother or a close relative. The most common signs\\nare nonspecific and include fever, failure to thrive, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and\\nsplenomegaly. The disease usually is miliary or disseminated. An early diagnosis is necessary for\\neffective treatment.\\nTreatment\\nA. Medical Therapy\\nUntreated tuberculosis is far riskier to the mother and fetus than any of the potential medications\\nnecessary to treat active disease. Treated TB does not seem to lead to adverse maternal or fetal\\noutcomes, whereas untreated cases are associated with intrauterine growth restriction, low birth\\nweight, and lower Apgar scores. A preventive course of isoniazid (isonicotinic acid hydrazide [INH])\\nis generally recommended for those with a positive skin test and no evidence of active disease. Unless\\nthere is high risk of developing TB (eg, close contact with a person with active disease), such\\npreventive therapy is withheld in those older than 35 years and during pregnancy and early postpartum\\nbecause of an increased risk for INH-related hepatitis, particularly in Latina and African American\\nwomen. Some authors recommended antepartum INH prophylaxis if there is well-documented\\nevidence of recent (<2 years) TB skin conversion to positive even if there are no other risk factors.\\nThe argument is that waiting until after delivery might not be as effective in preventing recurrences,\\nperhaps because the high frequency of noncompliance with medication taking postpartum.

The recommended dose of\\nINH is 300 mg/d for 6–9 months as well as pyridoxine (vitamin B\\n6\\n) to prevent INH-related\\nneuropathy. Periodic evaluation of liver function is recommended to detect hepatotoxicity early if it\\noccurs. Most studies have shown no teratogenic effects of INH.\\nActive tuberculosis should be treated as soon as the diagnosis is made. Most treatment programs\\nconsist of a 3-drug regimen, usually INH 5 mg/kg/d (total 300 mg/d), ethambutol 15 mg/kg/d, and\\nrifampin 10 mg/kg/d (maximum 600 mg/d) for 8 weeks, and the INH and rifampin to complete 9\\nmonths.

Because of the risk for fetal (and maternal) ototoxicity, streptomycin, kanamycin, and\\ncapreomycin should not be used. Isoniazid has many therapeutic advantages (eg, high efficacy, patient\\nacceptability, and low cost) and appears to be the safest drug for use during pregnancy. The major side\\neffects of INH are \\nhepatitis, hypersensitivity reactions, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal\\ndistress. A baseline liver function test should be obtained and then repeated periodically because of\\nhigher risk of hepatotoxicity during pregnancy and the first 6 months postpartum. Pyridoxine 50 mg/d\\nshould be administered to prevent INH-induced neuritis due to vitamin B\\n6\\n deficiency. Optic neuritis is\\na rare complication reported with ethambutol use. Rifampin may cause hepatitis, hypersensitivity\\nreactions, occasional hematologic toxicity, flulike syndrome, abdominal pain, acute renal failure, and\\nthrombocytopenia.

The incidence is the\\nsame in nonpregnant and pregnant females and averages 2–10%; however, a number of physiologic\\nchanges that occur during pregnancy predispose a woman to bacteriuria, including increased glucose\\nconcentration in the urine and increased stasis due to the relaxant progesterone effect. Risk factors for\\ndeveloping asymptomatic bacteriuria include low socioeconomic status, parity, age, sexual practice,\\nand medical conditions such as diabetes and sickle cell trait. \\nEscherichia coli\\n is the most common\\noffending organism for asymptomatic bacteriuria (approximately 80% of cases). The \\nKlebsiella-\\nEnterobacter-Serratia\\n group, \\nStaphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus\\n, group B \\nStreptococcus\\n, and\\nProteus\\n are responsible for the remainder of cases.\\nThe primary concern with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy is that it is associated with an\\nincreased risk of both maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy (see later).\\nPrevention\\nCertain underlying medical disorders may predispose a woman to asymptomatic bacteriuria during\\npregnancy. Asymptomatic bacteriuria is twice as common in pregnant women with sickle cell trait and\\n3 times as common in pregnant women with diabetes or with renal transplant as in normal pregnant\\nwomen. Therefore, we advise that monthly routine urine cultures should be performed in these women\\nwhen pregnant.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria is based on isolation of microorganisms with a colony'),\n",

When obtaining a clean-catch specimen, the\\npatient should be instructed to clean the vulvar area from front to back to avoid contamination of the\\nurine sample.\\nComplications\\nThe main risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria is the development of pyelonephritis. Due to anatomic\\ndilation in the renal system during pregnancy, there is increased stasis of urine in the pregnant urinary\\ntract and a much higher risk of developing an overt infection from the bacteruria. Due to this risk,\\nmany authorities advocate screening all pregnant women for bacteruria, and unlike nonpregnant\\nwomen, a pregnant woman found to have bacteruria should be treated promptly. If asymptomatic\\nbacteriuria is left untreated in pregnancy, up to 40% of patients will develop symptoms of urinary\\ntract infection (UTI), a significant increase from the almost negligible risk in nonpregnant women.\\nApproximately 25–30% of women will develop acute pyelonephritis. With treatment, the rate is less\\nthan 10%. Asymptomatic bacteriuria \\nhas been associated with preterm delivery, fetal loss, and\\npreeclampsia. Treatment of asymptomatic bacteruria has been associated in large reviews with a\\nreduction in the risk of preterm birth and low birth weight babies. On the other hand, approximately\\n2% percent of pregnant women with a negative urine culture will develop symptomatic cystitis and\\npyelonephritis.\\nTreatment\\nA midstream urine specimen should be collected for culture at the initial prenatal visit and repeated\\nlater in pregnancy. At each prenatal visit, dipstick testing should be performed. If proteinuria is\\npresent, urinalysis, culture, or both should be done. A pregnant woman with sickle cell trait should\\nhave urine culture and sensitivity testing every 4 weeks. The US Preventive Health Task Force states\\nthat single urine culture at 12–16 weeks’ gestation has 80% sensitivity. Alternatively, regular dipstick\\ntesting for leukocyte esterase and nitrites has a negative predictive value >95% and sensitivity of 50–\\n92%.\\nPregnant women should be encouraged to maintain adequate fluid intake and to void frequently.\\nThe initial antibiotic selection should be empiric. Based on the fact that the most common\\noffending pathogen is \\nE coli\\n, a sulfonamide, nitrofurantoin, or a cephalosporin is a reasonable choice.\\nThese antibiotics should be safe for the mother and fetus, with minimal side effects. A 5- to 14-day\\ncourse of one of these agents will effectively eradicate asymptomatic bacteriuria in approximately\\n65% of pregnant patients.

It occurs infrequently in\\npregnancy but carries a high mortality rate; therefore, it must be prevented when possible and treated\\naggressively. Most cases in pregnancy result from acute hypovolemia associated with obstetric\\nhemorrhage (placenta previa, placental abruption, or postpartum hemorrhage), preeclampsia, or\\nsepsis.\\nClinically, acute renal failure is a condition in which the kidneys are temporarily unable to perform\\ntheir excretory and regulatory functions. Blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine concentrations are\\nincreased. Without prompt intervention, the condition may result in abortion, low birthweight,\\npremature labor, and stillbirth. Dialysis may be required. Although hypotension-induced preterm\\ncontractions may occur during dialysis, numerous successful pregnancy outcomes have been reported\\nafter dialysis during pregnancy. In these cases renal failure most often is the result of intrinsic renal\\ndisease.\\nSimilar to nonpregnant patients, acute renal failure can be classified as prerenal, renal, or postrenal.\\nA classic formula in determining the cause of renal failure is the fractional excretion of sodium'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='(FENa). It is defined as the (urine sodium/plasma sodium) divided by (urine creatinine/plasma\\ncreatinine). It can also be stated as (urine sodium × plasma creatinine) divided by (urine creatinine ×\\nthe plasma sodium). Either way, it reflects the amount of sodium excreted as compared with the\\ncreatinine. If the renal tubules \\nare working (eg, as in prerenal failure) the sodium excretion should be\\nless than the creatinine, as the kidneys work extra hard to maintain sodium. If the tubules are not\\nworking (eg, renal cause, acute tubular necrosis), the kidneys will not be able to resorb sodium and the\\nfractional sodium excreted will be elevated. This can also be measured with urinary sodium levels.\\nIn the prerenal type, acute renal failure occurs due to renal hypoperfusion secondary to maternal\\nhypovolemia (eg, hemorrhage, hyperemesis gravidarum, dehydration, abruptio placentae, septicemia),\\ncirculating nephrotoxins (eg, aminoglycosides), aortic or renal artery stenosis or a narrowed off renal\\narteriole (due to sepsis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs], and certain dyes),\\nmismatched blood transfusion, preeclampsia–eclampsia, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and\\nhypoxemia (eg, chronic lung disease and heart failure). In prerenal failure, the patient typically is\\nclinically hypovolemic with an increased pulse and decreased blood pressure. Laboratory tests show a\\nserum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) to creatinine ratio >20, an FENa <1, urinary sodium <20 mEq/L\\n(often <10) and urinalysis with concentrated urine, few elements in sediment, and positive hyaline\\ncasts.\\nRenal causes can be divided into 4 groups: glomerular, tubular, interstitial and vascular. For all\\ngroups, the FENa is >1. Glomerular causes can be from systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE),\\npostinfectious glomerulonephritis, or membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis. In the preceding\\ncauses, low complement levels are found. With normal complement levels, the glomerular causes can\\nbe immunoglobulin A nephropathy, Goodpasture’s syndrome, or rapidly progressive\\nglomerulonephritis. In all glomerular causes, urinalysis shows red blood cell (RBC) casts, dysmorphic\\nRBC’s and protein.\\nWhen the renal failure is from the tubules, it is called acute tubular necrosis. It can be caused by an\\nischemic insult, shock, and surgery. It can also be caused by toxins, either endogenous (magnesium,\\ncreatinine phosphokinase) or exogenous (drugs, dyes, aminoglycosides). These patients typically have\\na normal physical exam. Urinalysis may be normal or may have brown pigmented casts. Urinary\\nsodium is >25 mEq/L (often >60). Again, FENa is >1.\\nRenal failure from the interstitium can be caused by NSAIDs and allergies (often to penicillins and\\ncephalosporins). Eosinophils are found in the blood and urine. The patients typically have a fever and\\nrash. If renal failure is caused by a vasculitis, “telescoped” urinary sediment may be seen, in which\\nred cells, white cells, oval fat bodies, and all types of casts are noted in relatively equal amounts.\\nThe postrenal type is caused by urinary obstruction from ureteric stone, retroperitoneal tumor, and\\nother diseases. Bilateral ureteral obstruction due to polyhydramnios is rare. The BUN to creatinine\\nratio is usually approximately 10.\\nPrevention\\nIn obstetric practice, prevention of acute renal failure should be the aim, with appropriate volume\\nreplacement to maintain adequate urine output. Proper management of high-risk obstetric conditions\\n(eg, preeclampsia–eclampsia, abruptio placentae, chorioamnionitis), ready blood availability, and\\navoidance of nephrotoxic antibiotics are important.\\nClinical Findings\\nAcute renal failure\\n is defined as urine output <400 mL in 24 hours (or <0.5 mL/kg/h) or an increase'),\n",

With moderate renal disease (creatinine 1.5–3 mg/dL), fetal outcome is\\nusually good (>90%), but maternal status often deteriorates (up to 40% of these women). With severe\\ndisease (creatinine >3 mg/dL), women are usually infertile, and if pregnancy is achieved, the outcome\\nfor both the fetus and the patient are poor.\\nThe normal physiologic changes seen in pregnancy are different in women with chronic renal'),\n",

Glomerular filtration rate does increase, but often only in the patients with mild disease.\\nProteinuria usually more than doubles in women with underlying renal disease. Interestingly, though,\\neven nephrotic range proteinuria is not considered by itself to be harmful to the patient or the fetus.\\nDespite all of the preceding generalizations, it is difficult to counsel women based on their serum\\ncreatinine alone. This is due to the fact that specific renal diseases tend to behave differently from one\\nanother. Therefore, it is important to know the patient’s underlying condition before managing her\\nduring pregnancy. Also, the presence of hypertension before conception, regardless of the patient’s\\nrenal function and serum creatinine, increases the risk to both mother and fetus. One generalization\\nthat can be made, though, is that women with chronic renal disease \\nare at increased risk of developing\\ngestational hypertension and preeclampsia. Therefore, all of these women should be watched closely\\nfor these diseases.\\nIt should be stated that most of the data regarding chronic renal disease and pregnancy are based on\\nretrospective and observational data only.\\nClinical Findings\\nChronic renal disease can be staged based on the patient’s glomerular filtration rate (\\nTable 28–2\\n).\\nWomen with chronic renal disease may also demonstrate some degree of elevation in serum\\ncreatinine.\\nTable 28–2\\n.

Patients with more than minimal disease should be comanaged by a\\nmaternal–fetal medicine specialist and either a nephrologist or an internist familiar with the\\nmanagement of renal diseases. Blood pressure should be strictly controlled. Baseline laboratory values\\nshould include serum creatinine, electrolytes, albumin, and cholesterol/triglycerides (for nephritic\\npatients), and some would add baseline liver function tests, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase levels\\nto help aid in the subsequent diagnosis of superimposed preeclampsia. A 24-hour urine collection for\\nprotein and creatinine clearance should be obtained as well. Patients should have close follow-up and\\nstart noninvasive fetal monitoring at approximately 32 weeks.

Glomerulonephritis\\nAcute glomerulonephritis during pregnancy is rare, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 40,000\\npregnancies. The condition is associated with increased perinatal loss. The clinical course is variable\\nduring pregnancy and may be easily mistaken for preeclampsia. In some patients, the condition\\nresolves early in pregnancy, with return to normal renal function. Microscopic hematuria with RBC\\ncasts is a common finding in acute glomerulonephritis. Treatment is similar to that of the nonpregnant\\npatient and consists of controlling blood pressure, preventing congestive heart failure, administering\\nfluids and electrolytes, and close follow-up.\\nThe outcome of pregnancy with chronic glomerulonephritis depends on the degree of functional\\nimpairment of the kidneys, blood pressure levels before conception, and the exact histology of the\\nglomerulonephritis. For patients with active glomerulonephritis, the principal risk for pregnancy is\\nsuperimposed preeclampsia. Conditions associated with poor fetal outcome include preexisting\\nhypertension, severe proteinuria during the first trimester, primary focal and segmental hyalinosis,\\nand sclerosis. Successful pregnancy should be anticipated, although renal function is expected to\\ndecrease. The incidence of fetal intrauterine growth restriction, premature labor, abruptio placentae,\\nand intrauterine fetal demise is increased. Routine prenatal care should include periodic renal function\\ntests, control of blood pressure, ultrasonic evaluation of fetal growth, and antepartum testing for fetal\\nwell-being. Hypertension at the time of conception correlates with worsening maternal renal function\\nduring pregnancy. Early delivery is indicated after evaluation of pulmonary maturity as appropriate.\\nB. Lupus Nephritis\\nIt is unclear whether patients with SLE are more likely to have a flare during pregnancy. It is known\\nthat an exacerbation is more likely if the patient has active disease at conception. Therefore, many\\npeople recommend delaying pregnancy until the SLE has been in remission for 6–12 months. This can\\ndecrease the risk of flare from 66% to 33%. What seems to be true is that pregnancy itself does not\\ncause \\nthe flare. In small controlled studies, the rate of flare is not different between SLE-similar\\npregnant and nonpregnant women. If a flare does occur, severe renal manifestations can occur.\\nPrednisone and other immunosuppressive agents have been used with success during pregnancy.\\nSLE patients, like other renal patients, also have a worse prognosis if pregestational hypertension\\nexists.

Reflux Nephropathy\\nReflex nephropathy is a disease of the urinary tract system that starts in childhood. It is a common and\\ngenerally mild disease. The majority of women have preserved renal function and are normotensive;\\nconsequently, their pregnancies are uneventful. The only significant complication that does develop is\\nbacteruria and urinary tract infections. Therefore, they should be frequently screened for bacteruria\\nand treated accordingly. In addition to this, because the disease may be inherited, their children should\\nbe evaluated after birth for this condition.\\nF. Polycystic Kidney Disease\\nAlthough the recessive form is quite rare and extremely severe, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney\\ndisease is more common and has been studied in pregnancy. Like other renal diseases, these patients\\ndo well in pregnancy if they start without hypertension and severe renal dysfunction. Again, like with\\nthe other diseases, they are more likely to develop gestational hypertension and preeclampsia. These\\npatients, however, are also more prone to develop urinary tract infections.\\nG. Solitary Kidney\\nA solitary kidney may be the result of developmental aberration or disease requiring removal of 1\\nkidney. A single kidney may be abnormally developed or it may be located low, perhaps even within\\nthe true pelvis. A second small, virtually functionless kidney may not be discovered by the usual\\ndiagnostic tests. Anatomic and functional hypertrophy of the kidney usually occurs and is augmented\\nby pregnancy. These patients should be evaluated preconceptually for the presence of infection. If\\nrenal function is normal, pregnancy is not contraindicated, and good outcomes are expected.\\nDuring pregnancy, infection in a solitary kidney must be treated aggressively. An increased rate of\\npreeclampsia with a solitary kidney has been reported.'),\n",

Renal Transplantation\\nApproximately 0.5% of women who have undergone transplantation in the reproductive age range\\nbecome pregnant. A number of large series document successful pregnancy outcomes after renal\\ntransplantation. Patients with adequate renal function before pregnancy will experience little if any\\ndeterioration in graft function during pregnancy. The likelihood of graft rejection during pregnancy\\nremains the same as in nonpregnant graft recipients. For renal transplant patients considering\\npregnancy, a stable serum creatinine level <1.4 mg/dL identifies a group more likely to experience an\\nuncomplicated obstetric outcome (97% vs. 75% for patients with a higher serum creatinine level). The\\nspontaneous abortion rate is not increased.\\nPatients should wait 2 years from transplantation to attempt pregnancy. They may wait only 1 year\\nif the kidney is from a living-related donor. This is done to avoid rejection. Despite this\\nrecommendation, women who do not wait this period are still likely to have a successful pregnancy.\\nPatients should have a serum creatinine of <2 (and preferably <1.5) as well as no signs of rejection\\nbefore conception. Patients should not be hypertensive or should be made normotensive with\\nmedication before conception.\\nAntirejection drugs should be reduced to maintenance levels (prednisone ≤15 mg/d and\\nazathioprine ≤2mg/kg/d; a safe dosage for cyclosporine has not been established but should be\\nmaintained <5 mg/kg/d if possible). Immunosuppressive levels should be checked frequently, \\nas\\nlevels tend to decrease in pregnancy. Patients on steroids should have early glucose intolerance\\nscreening. Electrolyte and liver function values should be checked every 6 weeks.\\nThe risk of infection is considerably higher during pregnancy in renal transplant patients. Primary\\nor reactivated herpesvirus or cytomegalovirus infection may be seen. A higher rate of hepatitis B\\nsurface antigenemia is seen in dialysis patients as well.\\nThe route of delivery depends primarily on obstetric indications. In patients with aseptic necrosis\\nof the hip joints or other bony dystrophy secondary to long-standing disease, caesarean delivery may\\nbe required. Vaginal delivery should be the aim for patients with renal transplant. A transplanted\\nkidney in the false pelvis usually does not cause obstruction leading to dystocia. If a caesarean section\\nbecomes indicated, close attention should be made not to damage the transplanted kidney, as it is\\ntypically located in the pelvis.\\nPreterm delivery, both spontaneous and indicated, is common (45–60%). Intrauterine growth\\nrestriction and fetal abnormalities caused by immunosuppressive agents taken by the mother may\\noccur.\\nI. Chronic Renal Disease Requiring Dialysis\\nAs opposed to the horrendous pregnancy outcome noted in older literature, there are data that women\\non dialysis have approximately a 50% chance of delivering a live infant, albeit often growth restricted\\nor premature. There are a number of pregnancy-related differences in dialysis management:\\n• Erythropoietin requirements are higher to maintain an appropriate hemoglobin concentration.\\n• Fetal heart and uterine contraction monitoring are required, as dialysis may induce hypotension or\\nplacental insufficiency.\\n• The placenta produces vitamin D, so the dose of calciferol may need to be reduced to avoid\\nhypercalcemia.\\n• Since pregnancy is a hypercoagulable state, more heparin may be required during dialysis.'),\n",

The majority are caused by \\nHelicobacter pylori\\n infection or the use of nonsteroidal anti-\\ninflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Pregnant patients tend to have milder symptoms than nonpregnant patients.\\nMost commonly, the diagnosis is confirmed by endoscopic visualization of the ulcer crater in the\\nstomach or duodenum.

Additionally, mild elevation of prothrombin time (PT)/partial\\nthromboplastin time (PTT) and decrease in fibrinogen may be seen in some women.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nThe differential diagnosis includes severe preeclampsia; a significant overlap in symptoms and\\nfindings may be seen, but HELLP is diagnosed when the previously mentioned laboratory findings are\\nmet. AFLP has abnormal PT/PTT more commonly and more significant liver failure. TTP and HUS do\\nnot affect hepatic function as frequently as HELLP syndrome.\\nComplications\\nComplications can include disseminated intravascular coagulation (21%), placental abruption (16%),\\nacute renal failure (8%), pulmonary edema (6%), and subcapsular liver hematoma (1%). Hepatic\\nrupture in patients with HELLP syndrome, especially with significant thrombocytopenia, has been\\nassociated with a 50% mortality rate. Risk factors for rupture include advanced maternal age,\\nmultiparity, and preeclampsia. Blood products may be required in up to 50% of affected pregnancies,\\nand maternal mortality may approach 1%. Neonatal loss rate may range from 7 to 25%, based on\\ngestational age at delivery and presence of growth restriction.'),\n",

Delivery is the primary\\ntreatment and is standard in all but special circumstances. Vaginal delivery is preferred unless there is\\nevidence of fetal growth restriction, placental abruption, or early gestational age with rapidly\\nworsening disease. Antenatal corticosteroids can be given for pregnancies <34 weeks, with some\\nbenefit conferred during the labor induction process. If caesarean section is required, a vertical\\nmidline incision is recommended secondary to fewer wound separations or infections. HELLP\\nsyndrome frequently resolves quickly after delivery, although the platelets and transaminases may\\nnadir up to 36 hours after delivery before improving. Intravenous steroids have not been shown to\\naffect long-term outcome, although one trial demonstrated more rapid recovery of the platelet count\\nwith steroids.\\nPrognosis\\nComplications of HELLP syndrome can be significant for both the mother and the fetus; however,\\nwith prompt recognition and delivery, the vast majority of patients rapidly improve. Recurrence rate\\nfor HELLP syndrome ranges from 3 to 25%, whereas the incidence of preeclampsia in subsequent\\npregnancies ranges from 25 to 75%.

A generalized viremia occurs with the infection\\nthat is predominantly hepatic. Symptoms include nausea, headaches, poor appetite, and weight loss.\\nAdditionally, diarrhea, fever, and jaundice can be seen. The primary mode of transmission is the\\nfecal–oral route. Excretion of the virus in stool normally begins approximately 2 weeks prior to the\\nonset of clinical symptoms and is complete within 3 weeks after the onset of clinical symptoms. No\\nknown carrier state exists for the virus. Both blood and stool are infectious during the 206-week\\nincubation period. Illness during the third trimester may be associated with an increased risk of\\npreterm labor. Vertical transmission of hepatitis A has not been reported, and breastfeeding is\\nencouraged with attention to appropriate hand washing. The hepatitis A vaccine is safe to receive\\nduring pregnancy.'),\n",

The virus is contained in most body secretions, and infection by parenteral and\\nsexual contact has been documented. Groups at risk for hepatitis B infection are intravenous drug\\nusers, men who have sex with men, health care personnel, spouses of hepatitis carriers, those with\\nmultiple sexual partners, and Southeast Asian emigrants. Approximately 5–10% of people infected\\nwith hepatitis B virus become chronic carriers of the virus. The incubation period is 6 weeks to 6\\nmonths. The clinical features of hepatitis A and B are similar, although hepatitis B is more insidious.\\nFulminant hepatitis is rare with hepatitis A but occurs in approximately 1% of patients infected with\\nhepatitis B.\\nThe hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is the marker usually measured in blood to document\\nprior exposure. This is the first manifestation of viral infection; it usually appears before clinical\\nevidence of the disease and lasts throughout the infection. Persistence of HBsAg after the acute phase\\nof hepatitis usually is associated with clinical and laboratory evidence of chronic hepatitis. The\\nhepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) is produced against the core of the viral particle and occurs with\\nacute hepatitis B infection at the onset of clinical illness. Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) is found only\\nwhen HBsAg is present. Pregnant women who are HBeAg positive in the third trimester frequently\\ntransmit this infection to the offspring (80–90%), whereas those who are negative have a much lower\\ntransmission rate (10–20%).\\nTreatment of an acute infection during pregnancy is supportive, and there is no associated\\nincreased mortality or teratogenicity. Women with elevated hepatitis B viral loads (>10\\n6\\n copies/mL)\\nor who are HBeAg positive during the third trimester are frequently treated with lamivudine, which\\nhas been demonstrated to significantly decrease the risk of vertical transmission. In addition,\\nnewborns born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive hepatitis B immunoglobulin within 12\\nhours after birth concurrently with the first pediatric dose of the vaccine. Breastfeeding is not\\ncontraindicated in patients with hepatitis B (chronic or acute).\\nHepatitis C\\nUp to 85% of infected individuals become chronic carriers. The incubation period usually is 7–8\\nweeks, but ranges from 3 to 21 weeks. The course of infection is similar to that of hepatitis B.\\nHepatitis C antibody is present in approximately 90% of patients. However, the antibody may not be\\ndetectable for weeks after infection. Acute or chronic hepatitis C does not adversely affect a\\npregnancy, with similar \\nrates of miscarriage, growth restriction, preterm delivery, or hypertensive\\ndisorders among infected patients and controls. Vertical transmission occurs in 5–8% of infected\\npregnancies and is increased with concomitant HIV infection (36%). The risk of vertical transmission\\nis increased with higher hepatitis C viral loads. The mode of delivery does not appear to influence\\ntransmission rate; however, fetal scalp blood sampling or placement of a fetal scalp electrode for fetal\\nheart rate monitoring should be avoided if possible. Prolonged rupture of membranes increases\\ntransmission risk, but in the premature fetus, risks of the gestational age must be balanced against the\\nrisk of transmission.

Acute inflammation during pregnancy is\\ntreated with intravenous fluids and limitation of oral intake. If acute cholecystitis does not resolve or\\nif pancreatitis develops, cholecystectomy should be considered. If this operation can be performed in\\nthe second trimester, the fetal loss rate is likely not increased. The laparoscopic approach in\\npregnancy is widely accepted. After 20 weeks’ gestation, it should be performed with special care to\\navoid injury to the uterus. In the third trimester, surgical intervention can contribute to preterm\\ndelivery, and monitoring of uterine contractions should be done after surgery. Additionally, it is\\ngenerally recommended to have fetal monitoring during the surgical procedure, especially if the\\npregnancy is past viability. See \\nChapter 25\\n (Surgical Disorders in Pregnancy) for an extended review\\nof this topic.\\nINTRAHEPATIC CHOLESTASIS OF PREGNANCY\\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy is characterized by accumulation of bile acids in the liver with\\nsubsequent accumulation in the plasma, causing pruritus and jaundice. It is similar to cholestasis that\\noccasionally occurs during combined oral contraceptive therapy. Estrogens are considered to play a\\nrole in its etiology, probably by slowing the enzymes involved in bile transport. Its incidence varies\\nwith geographical location and ethnicity (most common in Chile); there is an increased incidence with\\nmultiple pregnancies.\\nThe most significant symptom is total-body itching, specifically involving the palms and soles. The\\ndifferential diagnosis includes hepatitis and biliary tract disease, in addition to AFLP and the HELLP\\nsyndrome. Laboratory values show increased levels of alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin, and serum bile\\nacids (chenodeoxycholic acid, deoxycholic acid, cholic acid). AST and ALT levels may be mildly\\nelevated. Patients may be symptomatic weeks before the diagnostic laboratory abnormalities are\\nnoted.\\nSymptomatic treatment of pruritus with antihistamines such as diphenhydramine is useful as an\\ninitial therapy. Ursodeoxycholic acid (10–15 mg/kg/d in 2 divided doses) has been shown to inhibit\\nabsorption of bile acids and increase their biliary excretion. In doing so, the medication normalizes\\nbile acids, improves liver function tests, and alleviates pruritus. Oral steroids also have been used to\\nrelieve symptoms. There is rapid resolution of both laboratory abnormalities and symptoms after\\ndelivery.\\nIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy has been associated with fetal death, spontaneous preterm\\nbirth, meconium staining of the amniotic fluid and/or placenta, and postpartum hemorrhage. No\\nspecific method of antepartum testing has been demonstrated to prevent fetal demise, although twice-\\nweekly modified biophysical profile testing is suggested by some. Poor obstetrical outcomes seem to\\nbe highest in women with total bile acid levels >40 nmol/L. There is no consensus on management of\\npatients with regard to delivery; varying strategies include amniocentesis for fetal lung maturity\\nbetween 36 and 37 weeks’ gestational age, delivery at 37–38 weeks without fetal lung maturity\\nstudies, or allowing spontaneous labor to ensue if bile acids are <40 nmol/L and only intervening'),\n",

Hyperpigmentation is related to increased levels of melanocyte-stimulating\\nhormone, estrogen, and progesterone. Vascular changes are related to the effect of estrogen causing\\ncongestion, distention, and proliferation of blood vessels.\\nPrevention\\nFew interventions have been successful at preventing these changes, which occur as the result of\\nphysiologic processes. Judicious use of sunscreen may reduce the appearance of hyperpigmentation\\nand melasma. Varicosities in the legs may be prevented by leg elevation, support hose, and avoiding\\nprolonged sitting or standing.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms & Signs\\nHyperpigmentation\\n occurs in up to 90% of women, and it is more pronounced in women with darker\\nskin tones. It is most frequently localized in the nipples, areolae, and axillae. The linea alba darkens to\\nbecome the linea nigra, a dark linear streak on the midline of the abdomen.\\nMelasma\\n, also known as chloasma or “the mask of pregnancy,” is a symmetric brown\\nhyperpigmentation in malar, mandibular, or central facial areas. It is exacerbated by exposure to the\\nsun and certain cosmetics.\\nErythema\\n begins in early gestation and appears either diffuse and mottled or focused in the palmar\\nand thenar areas.\\nVenous congestion and vascular permeability during pregnancy can lead to \\nvaricosities\\n in up to\\n40% of women.

They are most commonly seen around the gums, tongue,\\nupper lip, and eyelids.\\nStriae, pinkish or purplish lines, may form on the abdomen, buttocks, and breasts. Striae form as a\\nresult of structural changes in the skin caused by weight gain and hormonal influence. Increased\\nactivity of the adrenal gland during pregnancy may increase their occurrence.\\nNonpitting \\nedema\\n of the face, eyelids, and extremities is observed in many pregnant women, with\\nchanges most pronounced in the morning and improving throughout the day.\\nChanges in the distribution and amount of hair are common during pregnancy. Increased hair\\ngrowth in facial areas and around the breasts occurs, particularly during the second and third\\ntrimesters. Importantly, there are no signs of virilization, and hirsutism regresses slightly or remains\\nunchanged postpartum. Increased recruitment of hair follicles into the growing phase (anagen) may\\nresult in thickening of scalp hair in late gestation. Postpartum loss of hair is fairly common. During\\npregnancy, the number of hair follicles in the resting phase (telogen) is decreased by about half and\\nthen nearly doubles in the first few weeks postpartum.\\nNails may become brittle with transverse grooving, distal onycholysis, and subungual\\nhyperkeratosis. These changes are benign and do not require treatment.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nIt is important to distinguish physiologic changes in pregnancy from more worrisome conditions.\\nErythema, for instance, might be diagnostic of hyperthyroidism, cirrhosis, or systemic lupus\\nerythematosus. Striae are normal findings in pregnancy but may be observed with adrenocortical\\nhyperactivity. Edema, while common, is also an important symptom of preeclampsia, and this\\ncondition should be considered in affected women. When pronounced nail onychodystrophy is seen,\\npsoriasis, lichen planus, and onychomycosis should be excluded.\\nComplications\\nIn general, cutaneous changes of pregnancy are of cosmetic concern only. Some vascular changes\\nresult in discomfort that may respond to supportive therapy.\\nTreatment\\nBecause most changes occurring in pregnancy improve postpartum, no therapy other than reassurance\\nis required. Many remedies have been proposed for striae in pregnancy (vitamin E oil, lubricants,\\nlotions), but none are effective. Laser technology is under investigation as a potential treatment and\\nhas shown some promise. If hyperpigmentation does not resolve postpartum, some patients respond to\\nretinoic acid and corticosteroid preparations. Vascular changes are not likely to completely regress\\npostpartum and may be treated with laser, electrodessication, or sclerotherapy.\\nPrognosis\\nHyperpigmentation decreases or, in most cases, disappears postpartum. Vascular changes may become\\nless pronounced but may not resolve completely. Striae usually become silvery-white and sunken, but\\nthey rarely disappear. Hair loss usually stops 2–6 months postpartum as the hair follicles enter the\\ngrowing phase (anagen).'),\n",

Stillbirths cluster around weeks 37–39\\nof pregnancy. Although the absolute cause of stillbirth is poorly understood, there is some evidence\\nsuggesting that the increased levels of circulating bile acids interfere with cardiac electrical\\nconduction leading to fetal arrhythmia and sudden stillbirth. Because stillbirth in these women\\nappears to be a sudden and unpredictable event, fetal surveillance with nonstress testing and/or\\nbiophysical profiles has not been shown to reduce the risk of adverse outcome. Nonetheless, most\\npractitioners advise the initiation of fetal surveillance twice per week once a diagnosis of ICP has\\nbeen made.\\nTreatment\\nUrsodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) may result in a sustained decrease in serum bile acids that improves\\nmaternal symptoms. UDCA has not been shown to reduce the risk of stillbirth, primarily because the\\nstudies evaluating the effect of UDCA on ICP were not powered to address the effect on fetal/neonatal\\noutcomes.

Greenspoon, MD\\nSue M. Palmer, MD\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, diabetes mellitus was estimated to affect\\n24 million people in the United States in 2008, an increase of 3 million over the preceding 2 years.\\nPrevalence of diabetes, primarily type 2 disease, is expected to rise even further by 2030, as a\\nconsequence of population aging, lifestyle changes, and increasing obesity rates. Approximately 25%\\nof adults with the condition are currently undiagnosed.\\nData suggest that this upward trend in prevalence is also affecting pregnant women. Preexisting\\ndiabetes affects 1% of all pregnancies, whereas approximately 7% of pregnant women are diagnosed\\nwith gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a condition traditionally defined as glucose intolerance\\nwith onset or first recognition during pregnancy. Even higher rates may be seen in certain minority\\ngroups, in particular African American and Hispanic gravidas.\\nBefore the introduction of insulin in 1922, women with preexisting diabetes did not often conceive.\\nWhen pregnancy did occur, it commonly resulted in the death of the mother. This fact prompted\\nJoseph de Lee to recommend in his seminal 1913 textbook that all such pregnancies be terminated. He\\nobserved that “the attempt to carry the pregnancy up to term or even to viability of the child is too\\nperilous.”\\nThe introduction of insulin, as well as improvements in general obstetric care, rapidly decreased\\nmaternal mortality. However, the risk of stillbirth and neonatal death remained much higher in\\ndiabetics than in the general population until the 1960s. Since that time, there has been a dramatic\\ndecrease in perinatal mortality due to improved neonatal intensive care, fetal surveillance, and greatly\\nimproved diabetic control, the result of self-blood glucose monitoring and intensified insulin\\nregimens. Today, if good glycemic control is achieved, the risk of perinatal mortality approaches that\\nof the general obstetric population. Nevertheless, both preexisting diabetes and GDM continue to pose\\nsignificant risks during pregnancy.\\nCurrently, the priorities for diabetes care providers are first to identify and control diabetes prior to\\nconception and second to appropriately screen and treat GDM during pregnancy in an effort to prevent\\nmaternal and fetal/neonatal complications. Evidence exists that treatment of even mild GDM results\\nin improved outcomes in both mother and baby.\\nMetabolism in Normal & Diabetic Pregnancy\\nTo accommodate the growth of a healthy fetus, profound metabolic changes occur in all pregnant\\nwomen during gestation. In particular, it is well established that insulin sensitivity decreases in\\nnormal women as gestation advances. However, despite much research, the mechanism behind this\\nphenomenon is unknown. Alterations in maternal cortisol levels, as well as in the placental hormones\\nincluding estrogen, progesterone, placental growth factor, and human placental lactogen (hPL) (also'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='known as human chorionic somatomammotropin), have all been implicated.\\nAlthough some degree of insulin resistance occurs in all women, only a relatively small number\\ndevelop GDM. Affected women share the same risk factors as patients with type 2 diabetes, and like\\ntype 2 disease, GDM is characterized both by insulin resistance and by inadequate insulin secretion. It\\ntherefore appears that GDM may be considered as type 2 diabetes that is unmasked by the\\ndiabetogenic milieu of pregnancy.\\nInsulin is an anabolic hormone with essential roles in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. It\\npromotes the uptake of glucose, storage of glucose as glycogen, lipogenesis, and uptake and utilization\\nof amino acids. A lack of insulin or decreased peripheral responsiveness to insulin results in\\nhyperglycemia and lipolysis. Elevation of free fatty acids leads to an increase in the formation of\\nketone bodies, acetoacetate, and β-hydroxybutyrate. When blood glucose levels exceed the renal\\nthreshold for absorption of filtered glucose, glycosuria occurs and causes an osmotic diuresis with\\ndehydration and electrolyte losses.\\nIn the first trimester of normal pregnancies, insulin sensitivity is unchanged or increased. This\\nappears to be because both estrogen and progesterone levels rise at this time but their effects on\\ninsulin activity are antagonistic. Progesterone causes insulin resistance, whereas estrogen has the\\nopposite effect. Because insulin secretion rises while insulin sensitivity is unchanged, the result is a\\ndecrease in fasting glucose levels, which reach a nadir by the 12th week. The decrease averages 15\\nmg/dL; thus, fasting values of 70–80 mg/dL are common by the 10th week of pregnancy.\\nHowever, in the second trimester, higher postprandial glucose levels occur, facilitating transfer of\\nglucose across the placenta from mother to fetus. Glucose transfer occurs via a facilitated diffusion\\nthat becomes saturated at 250 mg/dL. Fetal glucose levels are 80% of maternal levels. In contrast,\\nmaternal amino acid levels are lowered due to active placental transport to the fetus. Lipid\\nmetabolism in the second trimester shows continued maternal storage until midgestation, then\\nenhanced mobilization (lipolysis) as fetal fuel demands increase.\\nhPL, which increases up to 30-fold during pregnancy, is thought to be the hormone mainly\\nresponsible for insulin resistance and lipolysis. hPL also decreases the hunger sensation and diverts\\nmaternal carbohydrate metabolism to fat metabolism in the third trimester. hPL is similar in structure\\nto growth hormone and acts by reducing the insulin affinity to insulin receptors. The net effect is to\\nfavor placental transfer of glucose to the fetus and to reduce the maternal use of glucose. The hPL\\nlevels rise steadily during the first and second trimesters, with a plateau in the late third trimester.\\nMaternal cortisol levels, which likewise rise during pregnancy, may also contribute to insulin\\nresistance by stimulating endogenous glucose production and glycogen storage and decreasing glucose\\nutilization.\\nRecently, researchers have challenged the view that the insulin resistance of pregnancy is mediated\\nentirely by hormonal changes. Attention has turned to the role adipokines such as tumor necrosis\\nfactor-α (TNF-α), adiponectin, and leptin may play. In particular, the change in TNF-α level has been\\nfound to be a significant predictor of insulin resistance during pregnancy. TNF-α is produced by the\\nplacenta as well as by adipose tissue and may act in a paracrine fashion to impair insulin signaling\\nmechanisms, resulting in decreased insulin sensitivity.\\nFetal Effects of Hyperglycemia\\nElevated glucose levels are toxic to the developing fetus, producing an increase in miscarriages and\\nmajor malformations in direct proportion to the glucose level.

They may have an absolute insulin deficiency only during these attacks.\\nB. Type 2 Diabetes\\nType 2 diabetes mellitus, formerly non–insulin-dependent diabetes, is characterized both by insulin\\nresistance and by beta cell dysfunction.

It is typically gradual in onset and may go undiagnosed for many years. Ketoacidosis is rare\\nin this setting. The majority of affected patients are obese.\\nAlthough several genes have been associated with the disorder, progression to frank disease can be\\nmodified by factors such as diet and exercise. With type 2 diabetes, the risk of diabetes in a first-\\ndegree relative is almost 15%, and approximately 30% more will have impaired glucose tolerance.

According to the ADA, there are 4 ways of diagnosing\\ndiabetes in nonpregnant patients:\\n1. Symptoms of diabetes plus random plasma glucose concentration ≥200 mg/dL. The classic\\nsymptoms of diabetes include polyuria, polydipsia, and unexplained weight loss.\\n2. Fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dL.

Management is essentially the\\nsame in pregnant and nonpregnant patients and consists of insulin therapy, careful monitoring of\\npotassium level, and fluid replacement. Attention should also be paid to fetal well-being, but diabetic\\nketoacidosis is not an indication for delivery, because although fetal heart rate monitoring often\\ndemonstrates nonreassuring patterns initially, these usually improve as maternal ketoacidosis is\\ncorrected.\\nIntrapartum Management\\nThe goal of intrapartum management is to avoid maternal hyperglycemia and thus minimize the risk\\nof neonatal hypoglycemia after delivery.\\nGlucose infusion is provided to all patients in labor as 5% dextrose in lactated Ringer’s solution or\\na similar crystalloid. The rate usually is 125 mL/h (providing 6.25 g of glucose per hour) unless the\\npatient requires more. Intravenous fluid bolus prior to conduction anesthesia should not contain\\nglucose.\\nA bedside glucose monitor can be used to monitor glucose levels every 2–4 hours in early labor and\\nevery 1–2 hours in active labor. Patients requiring insulin may receive a continuous infusion of\\nregular insulin, often prepared as 25 U in 250 mL of saline (0.1 U/mL) according to the institution’s\\nprotocol for intravenous insulin. Most patients require approximately 0.5–2.0 U/h, although rates are\\nadjusted based on the capillary glucose level.\\nCervical ripening for induction of labor, if indicated, is conducted in the same manner as for\\nnondiabetic parturients. Continuous electronic fetal monitoring is used. In diabetic pregnancies, the\\nfetus’s ability to tolerate the stress of labor may be limited. Fetal heart rate abnormalities should be\\nevaluated with acoustic or scalp stimulation or fetal oxygen saturation monitoring. If fetal well-being\\ncannot be demonstrated, expeditious delivery, often by caesarean section, is indicated. If fetal\\nmacrosomia is suspected, operative vaginal delivery should be considered with great \\ncaution, if at all.\\nThe infant of the diabetic is at increased risk for shoulder dystocia, and this should be anticipated with\\nadequate personnel, obstetric anesthesia, and neonatal resuscitation available at delivery.\\nIf a repeat caesarean delivery or other elective surgery is planned, it should be scheduled for early\\nmorning, if possible. The patient should take her evening insulin or oral hypoglycemic dose on the\\npreceding night, but the morning dose should be held. The morning of surgery, the glucose level is\\nmonitored and basal insulin needs usually are treated with continuous intravenous insulin to maintain\\nblood glucose between 70 and 120 mg/dL.\\nPostpartum Care\\nPostpartum, the patient should start back on an ADA diet as soon as clinically indicated. Insulin\\nsensitivity increases markedly postpartum. In patients with GDM, blood glucose should normalize\\nafter delivery. In pregestational patients, as a rule of thumb, insulin doses can be reduced to\\napproximately half the pregnancy dose. Close monitoring of blood glucose should be continued,\\nparticularly in the setting of type 1 disease. If the patient underwent surgery, a sliding scale may be\\nimplemented until oral intake can be established. The glucose levels should be kept below 140–150\\nmg/dL to assist the patient in healing.

However, prevalence of the disease is\\nexpected to continue to rise as a result of the increasing prevalence of risk factors such as obesity in\\nthe gravid population.\\nThe hallmark of GDM is insulin resistance, and as such, it is etiologically similar to type 2\\ndiabetes. Indeed, many patients with a diagnosis of GDM that is made early in gestation may in fact\\nhave glucose intolerance that antecedes the pregnancy. Likewise, it is known that as many as 50% of\\npatients with GDM will ultimately go on to develop type 2 diabetes later in life. In recognition of this,\\nthe International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) recently\\nrecommended that high-risk women found to have diabetes by standard criteria early in pregnancy be\\nclassified as having “overt” rather than “gestational” diabetes.\\nGDM and type II diabetes are pathogenetically related. In fact, GDM can be considered to be type 2\\ndisease that is unmasked by the metabolic changes of pregnancy. Therefore, it is not surprising that\\nthe risk factors for both conditions are similar and include obesity, family history, minority ethnicity,\\nand older age.\\nThe progressive insulin resistance that occurs in normal pregnancies is associated with an increase\\nin insulin release by the beta cells of the pancreas in order to maintain glucose homeostasis.

These defects\\ninclude the regulations of glucose clearance, glucose production, and plasma-free fatty acid\\nconcentrations, together with defects in pancreatic beta cell function, which precede the development\\nof type 2 diabetes.\\nClinical Findings\\nDespite decades of research, the optimal approach to screening and diagnosis of GDM has remained\\nthe subject of much controversy. Risk assessment for GDM is performed at the first prenatal visit in\\nall women who do not already have diagnosed diabetes. Women at high risk should undergo screening\\nwith plasma glucose as soon as feasible. High-risk characteristics include the following:\\n1. Age >35–40 years\\n2. Obesity (nonpregnant body mass index [BMI] >30)\\n3. Prior history of GDM\\n4. Heavy glycosuria (>2+ on dipstick)\\n5. History of unexplained stillbirth\\n6. Polycystic ovarian syndrome\\n7. Strong family history of diabetes\\nIf results of testing do not demonstrate diabetes, these women should be retested between 24 and 28\\nweeks’ gestation.\\nIn the past, universal plasma screening was recommended for all women. However, it is acceptable\\nto forgo this in women deemed to be of low risk. A low-risk individual meets all of the following\\ncriteria:\\n1. Age <25 years\\n2. Not a member of an ethnic group at increased risk (ie, not Hispanic American, African American,\\nNative American, Asian American, or Pacific Islander)\\n3. BMI ≤325\\n4. No previous history of abnormal glucose tolerance\\n5. No previous history of adverse obstetric outcome\\n6. No known diabetes in a first-degree relative\\nHowever, when these criteria are applied, only 10% of the population will be exempt from\\nscreening; therefore, many obstetricians believe it is more practical to administer a plasma glucose\\nscreen in all pregnant women.\\nCurrently, both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the ADA advocate a\\n2-step approach to screening. Step 1 consists of a 1-hour 50-g oral glucose challenge test (GCT),\\nwhich is administered between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. The GCT can be performed at any time\\nof day and without regard to time of prior meal. If this screening test is positive, it is followed by the\\ndiagnostic test, a 3-hour 100-g OGTT.'),\n",

The\\noriginal blood glucose value for an abnormal screen (>140 mg/dL) was chosen arbitrarily and later\\nvalidated by its ability to predict future development of diabetes in the mother and not by any\\ncorrelation with adverse pregnancy outcome. In fact, the blood glucose threshold above which adverse\\noutcomes begin to increase has never been established. The recent Hyperglycemia and Adverse\\nPregnancy Outcome (HAPO) study addressed this issue and found that no discrete threshold exists.\\nInstead, there is a continuous relationship between blood glucose levels and adverse outcome. This\\nstudy confirmed that even in women who did not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of GDM, the risk of\\ncomplications increased in proportion to an increase in blood glucose.\\nAt the blood glucose threshold of 140 mg/dL, 80% of patients with GDM will be detected, but\\napproximately 15% of all patients screened will require further definitive testing.

In 2010, following publication of the findings of the HAPO study, the IADPSG proposed\\nthat this 1 -step approach replace the current screening and diagnostic tests.

Screening for subclinical thyroid disorders remains a highly debated topic.\\nTHYROID FUNCTION DURING NORMAL PREGNANCY\\nThe thyroid, a gland that functions to provide thermal and metabolic regulation, develops from the\\nthird week in gestation from the primitive pharynx. The gland then migrates to the neck and starts to\\nproduce thyroid hormone by 10–12 weeks’ gestation.\\nMaternal thyroid physiology is altered during normal pregnancy. There is glandular hyperplasia\\nwith thyroid enlargement. Thyroid volume is increased on ultrasound examination, but the\\nechostructure is unchanged. The normal increase in the renal glomerular filtration rate causes an\\nincrease in urinary iodide clearance, necessitating increased intake of dietary iodine in order to make\\nand maintain thyroid hormone concentrations. Both total thyroxine (T\\n4\\n) and triiodothyronine (T\\n3\\n)\\nlevels increase because the level of their carrier, thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG), becomes elevated.\\nEstrogen causes increased TBG synthesis with decreased TBG clearance. Because of the similar\\nsubunits of chorionic gonadotropin and thyrotropin (thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]), crossover\\nbetween these 2 peptides can lead to an increase in free thyroxine (fT\\n4\\n) in the first trimester. The TSH\\nlevel is lowest and fT\\n4\\n level highest when human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels peak. Elevated\\nfT\\n4\\n causes suppression of TSH, which, in turn, causes barely detectable levels of maternal thyrotropin-\\nreleasing hormone (TRH). Overall, the demand for T\\n4\\n increases by an estimated 1–3% above daily\\nnonpregnant needs. The increased demand starts very early, reaching a plateau at 16–20 weeks. These\\nnormal physiologic changes make diagnosis of thyroid disease during pregnancy difficult.\\nStudies from animal models have helped to elucidate the role of maternal T\\n4\\n in the fetus. T\\n3\\n is\\nmade by conversion of maternal T\\n4\\n. It has been demonstrated that if maternal T\\n4\\n is low, fetal T\\n3\\n levels\\nin the brain will be low even in the presence of normal maternal and fetal serum T\\n3\\n, suggesting that\\nboth T\\n3\\n and T\\n4\\n in the fetal brain are maternal T\\n4\\n dependent. Further evidence of a maternal source of\\nT\\n3\\n in the fetal brain is that by midgestation, fetal concentration of T\\n3\\n is 34% of adult levels. This is\\nmuch higher than would be expected considering the low circulating fetal serum levels. It is during\\nmidgestation that initial growth velocity of the fetal brain occurs, and animal data suggest that the\\nthyroid hormone necessary for this development is primarily maternally derived. Toward the end of\\nthe first trimester, the fetal hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis becomes active. By 14 weeks’\\ngestation, fetal production of T\\n4\\n is detectable. Normal thyroid hormones levels in the fetus and\\nnewborn are crucial for subsequent brain maturation and intellectual development.'),\n",

Graves’\\ndisease is caused by thyroid-stimulating antibody (TSAb) belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) G\\nclass, which binds with high affinity to the TSH receptor. TSAb may cross the placenta, bind to fetal\\nTSH receptors, and cause fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism. However, the placenta acts as a partial\\nbarrier, so usually only those with high titers are likely to be affected. Other causes of\\nhyperthyroidism include thyroiditis, thyroid adenoma, and multinodular goiter.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism—heat intolerance, fatigue, anxiety, diaphoresis,\\ntachycardia, and a widened pulse pressure—can all be found during normal pregnancy. Signs specific\\nto hyperthyroidism would be pulse >100 bpm, goiter, and exophthalmos, but these may not be present.\\nGastrointestinal symptoms such as severe nausea and vomiting may also be present, but these can be\\nrelated to β-hCG elevations. Laboratory tests will confirm elevated T\\n4\\n, fT\\n4\\n, T\\n3\\n, and free T\\n3\\n (fT\\n3\\n)\\nlevels and a suppressed or undetectable TSH level. TSAb titers will be elevated in a significant\\nnumber of patients. Other laboratory findings may include a normocytic, normochromic anemia, mild\\nneutropenia, and elevated liver enzymes.\\nSubclinical hyperthyroidism, a condition resulting from suppressed levels of TSH and normal\\nlevels of T\\n4\\n and T\\n3\\n, is also seen in pregnancy. It was determined that 1.7% of screened women had\\nsubclinical disease. There is no effect of subclinical hyperthyroidism in pregnancy, so screening and\\ntreatment for this entity are not warranted.\\nComplications\\nThe most common complication of hyperthyroidism in pregnancy is preeclampsia. With large\\namounts of trans-placental transfer of thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins, thyrotoxicosis could\\ndevelop in the fetus or newborn. Fetal hypothyroidism may also result from overadministration of\\nthioamides. Poorly controlled hyperthyroidism has also been associated with an increased risk of\\nmiscarriage, pre-term labor, and low-birth-weight infants.\\nThyroid storm is a life-threatening complication of women with hyperthyroidism that may result in\\nheart failure if untreated. This complication developed in 8% of women with thyrotoxicosis. Classic\\nfindings of thyroid storm include thermoregulatory dysfunction; central nervous system (CNS) effects\\nincluding agitation, delirium, and coma; gastrointestinal dysfunction; and cardiovascular\\nmanifestations such as tachycardia or heart failure. This can be precipitated by labor and delivery,\\ncaesarean delivery, infection, or preeclampsia. T\\n4\\n-induced cardiomyopathy, however, is reversible.'),\n",

The medications available are propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole.

Some physicians prefer PTU, but reports of large numbers of patients indicate that the 2 drugs are\\nequally effective and have similar side effects. PTU is shorter acting, meaning more pills are required\\nmore often; therefore, methimazole may be preferable when compliance is a problem. The initial\\nmethimazole dose is 20–40 mg/d, and the initial PTU dose is 200–400 mg/d. The dose is gradually\\nreduced as improvement occurs. Most women can be effectively treated on an outpatient basis;\\nhowever, hospitalization may be considered in severe, uncontrolled cases in the third trimester\\nbecause of increased risk for complications. Women who have remained euthyroid while taking small\\namounts of PTU (≤100 mg/d) or methimazole (≤10 mg/d) for 4 weeks or longer can stop taking the\\nmedication altogether by 32–34 weeks’ gestation under close surveillance. The purpose is to minimize\\nthe risk of fetal/neonatal hypothyroidism, which is otherwise uncommon with PTU doses ≤200 mg/d\\nor methimazole ≤20 mg/d. The therapy is resumed if symptoms recur. Women with large goiters,\\nlong-standing hyperthyroidism, or significant eye involvement should remain on treatment throughout\\npregnancy. Other potential side effects of antithyroid medications are pruritus, skin rash, urticaria,\\nfever, arthralgias, cholestatic jaundice, lupus-like syndrome, and migratory polyarthritis. Leukopenia\\nmay be a medication effect but is also seen in untreated Graves’ disease; therefore, a white blood cell\\n(WBC) count should be obtained before treatment is started. Agranulocytosis is the most severe\\ncomplication, but fortunately, it is uncommon and found in only 0.1% of patients. Treatment prior to\\npregnancy is preferred to treatment during pregnancy because outcomes tend to be better. Recently,\\nmethimazole has become the treatment of choice for hyperthyroidism in pregnancy. This is because\\nPTU has been found to cause irreversible liver damage, leading potentially to liver failure.\\nβ-Blockers (propranolol 20–40 mg every 6–8 hours) can be used for symptomatic relief in severe\\ncases but only for short periods (few weeks) and before 34–36 weeks’ gestation. They inhibit\\nconversion from T\\n4\\n to T\\n3\\n but may be related to \\nintrauterine growth restriction and hypoglycemia if\\nused for prolonged periods of time.\\nTreatment of thyroid storm is aimed at reducing synthesis of thyroid hormone, minimizing release\\nof thyroid hormone from the thyroid gland, and blocking peripheral effects of thyroid hormone.\\nAggressive treatment for thyroid storm is critical to the patient’s survival. PTU or methimazole is\\nstarted immediately and may be administered via nasogastric tube if the patient has altered mental\\nstatus. Iodine solution such as potassium iodide (SSKI) or Lugol’s solution may also be given. Iodine\\nsolution works by inhibiting thyroid hormone release. If the patient has a history of iodine-induced\\nanaphylaxis, then lithium carbonate is given instead. Fluid hydration and nutritional support are also\\nimportant. β-Blockers are also given for relief of symptoms such as tachycardia and palpitations, and\\nthey may also inhibit peripheral conversion of T\\n4\\n to T\\n3\\n. Glucocorticoids may also be used in severe\\ncases to reduce peripheral conversion of T\\n4\\n to T\\n3\\n.

This makes the overall incidence of\\nhypothyroidism 2.5%.\\nThe most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, which is found in 8–10% of\\nwomen of reproductive age. Less common causes are transient hypothyroidism in silent (painless) and\\nsubacute thyroiditis, drug induced, high-dose external neck radiation, congenital hypothyroidism,\\ninherited metabolic disorders, and thyroid hormone resistance syndromes. Secondary hypothyroidism\\nmay occur in pituitary or hypothalamic disease. Drugs that may cause hypothyroidism by interfering\\nwith thyroid hormone synthesis and/or its release include antithyroid drugs (PTU, methimazole),\\niodine, and lithium. Increased T\\n4\\n clearance is caused by carbamazepine, phenytoin, and rifampin.\\nAmiodarone decreases T\\n4\\n to T\\n3\\n conversion and inhibition of T\\n3\\n action.

Just over 120 cases have been reported since 1931, with the first successful surgery\\nperformed in 1947. Hyperparathyroidism peaks in incidence from the third to fifth decades; however,\\nit is rare in pregnancy, with an incidence of 0.8%. The PTH level remains unchanged during the first\\nhalf of pregnancy and then rises gradually until term, coinciding with the time of greatest fetal\\nskeletal calcification. PTH promotes calcium (Ca) transport from mother to fetus. The most potent\\nfactor affecting PTH secretion is the free Ca level (inverse correlation), but calcitonin, vitamin D, and\\nmagnesium also play a role. Calcitonin is secreted by C cells inside the thyroid, but these cells\\nactually are of neural crest origin and migrate to the thyroid. Calcitonin is a Ca-lowering hormone\\nwhose secretion is also mainly affected by free Ca levels, but in this case, the correlation is direct. Its\\naction is antagonistic to that of PTH, and it plays a role in Ca homeostasis and bone remodeling.\\nVitamin D increases the efficiency of intestinal Ca absorption, plays a role in the maintenance of Ca\\nand phosphorus levels, and has a role in the mineralization of bone matrix. In order to exert its action,\\nvitamin D must be transformed into active metabolites [1,25-(OH)\\n2\\nD\\n3\\n] in the kidney, and PTH is\\nneeded for the process. Hyperparathyroidism is characterized by hypercalcemia, which is a result of\\nelevated PTH. Most patients are asymptomatic, but those with symptoms generally will have nausea,\\nvomiting, renal colic, muscular weakness, mental symptoms, and polyuria.\\nWhether Ca metabolism during pregnancy is influenced by other hormones, such as estrogen,'),\n",

PTH facilitates this transport, although neither PTH nor calcitonin crosses the placenta. The\\nfetal Ca concentration (both total and free) increases gradually from 5.5 to 11.0 mg/dL from the\\nsecond trimester to term. In the fetus, the PTH level is suppressed but detectable, and cord levels are\\n25% lower than in the mother. Calcitonin in cord is higher than in the mother, a combination favoring\\nskeletal growth, which also causes Ca levels in the newborn to fall to normal. Given these findings, all\\nthe observed changes in normal pregnancy favor mineralization of the fetal skeleton.\\nDuring pregnancy, the etiology of hyperparathyroidism is an adenoma in 89–90% of cases,\\nhyperplasia (of all the glands) in 9%, and carcinoma in 1–2%. The latter should \\nbe suspected in severe\\nhyperparathyroidism, particularly if a palpable neck mass is present (palpable neck masses are\\nreported in <5% of parathyroid adenomas). Rarely, it occurs in a familial pattern with or without other\\nendocrine abnormalities (eg, multiple endocrine adenomatosis). Other causes of hypercalcemia during\\npregnancy are uncommon and include vitamin D toxicity, sarcoidosis, various malignancies, milk-\\nalkali syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, adrenal insufficiency, and secondary hyperparathyroidism in those\\nundergoing chronic hemodialysis or after renal transplantation.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe most common presentation of hyperparathyroidism is asymptomatic elevation in serum Ca level.\\nIf patients are symptomatic, it is usually related to the hypercalcemia, which may manifest with\\nneuropsychiatric disturbances such as depression and anxiety, constipation, nausea, renal stones,\\nand/or polyuria. Serum intact PTH levels are elevated in most patients with hyperparathyroidism. A\\ndiagnosis of hyperparathyroidism can be confirmed with elevated urinary Ca excretion levels.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nBecause hyperparathyroidism can be primary (from elevated PTH) or secondary (generally from a\\ncancer-secreting PTH), the differential diagnosis includes a thorough search for malignancy.\\nComplications\\nReported complications include 27.5% fetal mortality and 19% neonatal tetany. Neonatal\\nhypocalcemia is often the initial clue to the presence of maternal hyperparathyroidism. The condition\\noccurs because the high levels of maternal Ca inhibit the activity or the proper development of the\\ninfant’s parathyroid glands. It develops between days 2 and 14 after delivery, depending on the\\nseverity of the maternal hyper-calcemia, and usually resolves with appropriate therapy.

Maternal deaths have occurred among those with\\ncomplications of pancreatitis or hypercalcemic crisis. Women who developed hypercalcemic crisis\\nhad a 30% maternal death rate and 40% fetal demises. Pancreatitis is reported in only 1.5% of\\nnonpregnant hyperparathyroid patients and in <1% of normal pregnancies.

The diagnosis\\nusually is evident from the history and confirmed by a “normal” or low PTH level in the presence of\\nhypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and normal renal function.\\nComplications\\nAfter delivery, hypoparathyroid women may develop hypercalcemia with the same dose of Ca and\\nvitamin D that was effective during pregnancy. Hypersensitivity to vitamin D in lactating women may\\nresult from the effect of prolactin on 1α-hydroxylase vitamin D activity. Serum Ca levels should be\\nmonitored closely and the doses readjusted as necessary. Vitamin D travels into breast milk, even\\nwhen low doses are taken, so many physicians discourage breastfeeding in these women.\\nTreatment\\nFrom 1–4 g/d of elemental Ca and 50,000–100,000 U/d of vitamin D usually are recommended.

Excess cortisol, either\\nendogenous or exogenous, suppresses gonadotropin secretion. Cushing’s syndrome is usually due to\\nan adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)–producing pituitary tumor (Cushing’s disease), ectopic\\nACTH secretion by a nonpituitary tumor, or cortisol secretion by an adrenal adenoma or carcinoma,\\nalthough the most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome is exogenous corticosteroid treatment.'),\n",

About 25% of Cushing’s syndrome will be\\ncorticotropin independent and caused by an adrenal adenoma.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe clinical diagnosis is difficult because the changes occur insidiously. During pregnancy, the\\ndiagnosis is even more difficult because weight gain, skin striae (stretch marks), and fatigue are\\ncommon during normal pregnancy, but all other symptoms and signs will be the same as outside of\\npregnancy and include hypertension, hirsutism, and glucose intolerance among many others. The\\nlaboratory diagnosis also is more difficult during pregnancy. Urinary free cortisol excretion may\\noverlap with that seen in some cases of Cushing’s syndrome, and the suppression to exogenous\\ncorticosteroids may be incomplete. However, the diurnal variations of both ACTH and cortisol are\\npreserved; therefore, measurement of morning and evening cortisol levels remains very useful.\\nTherefore, the diagnosis may be confirmed by the loss of diurnal variation; elevated levels of urinary\\nfree cortisol, particularly if >250 mg per 24 hours; and lack of cortisol suppression to dexamethasone.\\nMeasurements of ACTH may be useful as well (“normal” or high in Cushing’s disease and suppressed\\nin adrenal tumors). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may confirm the presence of a pituitary or\\nadrenal tumor. A few cases of “pregnancy-induced” Cushing’s syndrome with spontaneous resolution\\npostpartum have been reported and attributed to a placental corticotropin-releasing factor. However,\\nlong-term follow-up revealed other causes of Cushing’s syndrome in most of the women.\\nComplications\\nThe most common complication (64%) is preterm labor, resulting in considerable fetal morbidity and\\nmortality. Intrauterine growth restriction occurs in 26–37% and fetal losses (spontaneous abortions\\nand stillbirths) in 16%. Little information about the long-term quality of survival of those born\\npremature but alive is available. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus complicate 70% and 32% of these\\npregnancies, respectively, and unfavorably influence the outcome of these pregnancies if untreated.\\nMaternal mortality has occurred in 5% of cases.\\nTreatment\\nAn attempt at some form of treatment is advocated given the poor outcome. Surgery in the second\\ntrimester can be attempted when a pituitary or adrenal tumor is found. Few reports of these procedures\\nperformed during pregnancy are documented. Medical therapy is limited, and the potential side effects\\nof the medications are not well known. Metyrapone, cyproheptadine, aminoglutethimide, and\\nketoconazole (teratogenic in animals) have been used in a few patients.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Pathogenesis\\nPrimary adrenocortical insufficiency (Addison’s disease) often is the result of autoimmune\\ndestruction of the adrenal glands (in the era before antibiotics, tuberculosis was the most common\\ncause). More than 90% of the gland has to be destroyed for symptoms to develop. Occasionally, it is\\nassociated with other autoimmune endocrine disorders (polyendocrine autoimmune deficiency) such\\nas diabetes, Graves’ disease, or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Secondary adrenal failure results from\\nreduced or absent ACTH secretion caused by various pituitary disorders or inhibition from chronic\\nexogenous steroid use. Causes of partial or complete anterior pituitary insufficiency in women of\\nreproductive age include tumors, pituitary surgery or radiation, and postpartum infarction (Sheehan’s\\nsyndrome). Less common causes are acute pituitary hemorrhage, infiltration by granulomatous\\ndiseases, thalassemia, necrosis from increased intracranial pressure, and lymphocytic hypophysitis. A\\nfew cases of pituitary necrosis in pregnant type 1 diabetic women have been reported.\\nClinical Findings\\nSymptoms include weakness, fatigue, nausea and vomiting, and weight loss. On laboratory testing, the\\npatient is found to have low cortisol levels.\\nTreatment\\nSince the advent of steroid treatment, most pregnancies have been successfully managed. Even women\\nwith anterior pituitary insufficiency may conceive because of advances in infertility treatment and,\\nwith proper hormonal replacement, may carry their pregnancies to term. Infants of well-treated\\nmothers with adrenal insufficiency appear to be normal. The daily steroid replacement dose is 20–25\\nmg/m\\n2\\n by mouth (ie, 30–37.5 mg/d of hydrocortisone or equivalent steroid). Two-thirds of the daily\\ndose (20–25 mg) is given in the morning and one-third (10–12.5 mg) in the late afternoon. Usually the\\ndaily dosage does not need to be changed during pregnancy. However, compensation is required for\\nperiods of stress and during labor and delivery (up to 300 mg of hydrocortisone or equivalent steroid\\ngiven intravenously in divided doses the first day and gradual tapering to the maintenance dose over\\nthe next several days). In secondary adrenal insufficiency, mineralocorticoid replacement is not\\nnecessary, but women with primary adrenal disease also should receive fludrocortisone 0.05–0.1 mg/d\\nby mouth.\\nCONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n The most common cause is 21-hydroxylase deficiency.\\n Elevated serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone is seen.\\n Clinical signs include virilization, hirsutism, and menstrual irregularities. Neonates affected by\\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia may present with ambiguous genitalia.\\nPathogenesis\\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia can be caused by a number of different genetic defects in enzymes\\ninvolved in cortisol synthesis. These enzymatic deficiencies are inherited as autosomal recessive traits\\n(25% risk of inheriting the condition and 50% of being a carrier). Of the several inherited enzymatic'),\n",

Affected individuals may have salt\\nwasting. Later in life, women may experience acne, accelerated bone age, hirsutism, and menstrual\\nirregularity. The diagnosis of classic 21-hydroxylase deficiency is made based on high serum\\nconcentrations of 17-hydroxyprogesterone. Patients with nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deficiency may\\nhave only mild elevations in 17-hydroxyprogesterone yet will have very high values after ACTH\\nstimulation test.\\nIf both parents are known to carry a gene associated with autosomal recessive inheritance of\\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia, prenatal diagnosis is available via chorionic villus sampling or\\namniocentesis to determine whether the fetus is affected.\\nComplications\\nComplications vary depending on whether the mother or the fetus (or both) carry a diagnosis of\\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia. When the fetus is affected, the low cortisol level stimulates excessive\\nACTH secretion, which in turn causes adrenal enlargement, or hyperplasia. The excessive secretion of\\nandrogens leads to masculinization of the external genitalia (congenital sexual ambiguity) and the low\\ncortisol level to adrenal insufficiency. Untreated, these conditions can be life threatening.\\nIn many cases, the diagnosis is made and treatment initiated after birth when the newborn becomes\\nill. However, prenatal diagnosis (chorionic villous sampling and DNA testing) now is commonplace\\nwhen both parents are known to be carriers of a mutation associated with congenital adrenal\\nhyperplasia.\\nTreatment\\nIf the fetus is found to have 21-hydroxylase deficiency and the fetus is female, treatment of the\\nmother with dexamethasone may prevent the development of adrenal hyperplasia and virilization of\\nthe external genitalia. The sex of the fetus can be determined by chorionic villous sampling, so early\\ntreatment can be initiated. Those born with virilization of the external genitalia will require surgical\\nreconstruction to allow vaginal intercourse.\\nIn affected females, the earlier the treatment is initiated, the higher the likelihood that they will be\\novulatory and fertile. During pregnancy, glucocorticoid therapy should be continued and adjusted to\\navoid excessive androgen levels. Otherwise the steroid management is the same as described for\\nadrenal insufficiency. Genetic counseling should be mandatory for these women, before they consider\\npregnancy, given the high risk of transmission and the severity of the disease.\\nIf the mother is known to be affected by congenital adrenal hyperplasia, her regimen of\\nglucocorticoid will likely require an increase in dose during pregnancy to maintain levels within the\\nnormal range for pregnancy.

They generally arise as lactotroph\\nadenomas from monoclonal expansion of a single cell that has undergone a mutation. Most cases of\\nprolactinomas are sporadic, but they have also been described as a clinical feature of multiple\\nendocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1).\\nClinical Findings\\nThe most common symptoms include amenorrhea, galactorrhea, and hyperprolactinemia.\\nBromocriptine has been used successfully to prevent amenorrhea, and thus, many women have had\\nsuccessful pregnancies. The diagnosis usually is made when the prolactin level is high enough to\\ncause galactorrhea, oligomenorrhea, or amenorrhea. MRI confirms the diagnosis. The tumors are\\ndivided into microadenomas (<10 mm) or macroadenomas (≥10 mm). The risk of growth during\\npregnancy is low (1–2%) for microadenomas, in contrast to the 15–25% risk of growth for untreated\\nmacroadenomas.

In normal pregnancy, pituitary growth hormone\\nconcentrations will decrease as placental epitopes are secreted.

Octreotide has been used\\nsuccessfully. However, bromocriptine administration throughout gestation without untoward effects to\\nmother or infant has been reported. The data for octreotide are limited, so until its safety is\\ndetermined, octreotide should be stopped when pregnancy is diagnosed.

Sheehan described the syndrome bearing his name as partial or complete pituitary insufficiency\\ndue to postpartum necrosis of the anterior pituitary gland in women with severe blood loss and\\nhypotension during delivery. Nevertheless, up to 10% of cases have no history of bleeding or\\nhypotension. The clinical manifestations depend on the extent of pituitary destruction and hormonal\\ndeficiencies. With destruction of 90% or more, symptoms of acute adrenal insufficiency predominate\\n(see Adrenal Insufficiency). Women may present with persistent hypotension, tachycardia,\\nhypoglycemia, and failure to lactate. If the condition is not treated promptly, serious complications\\nand even death may occur. In most cases, the full-blown picture may take longer, even years, to\\nappear. The most common manifestation of this syndrome is in women who have recently delivered\\nand suffered a postpartum hemorrhage. This leads to an infarct in the pituitary due to low blood flow\\nin that region.\\nClinical Findings\\nFailure to lactate, breast involution, and, if untreated, breast atrophy may occur. Fatigue, weight loss,\\nand postural hypotension are common complaints. Hyponatremia and anemia (usually normocytic and\\nnormochromic) are frequent laboratory abnormalities. Hormonal deficiencies point to a secondary\\ncause, with low T\\n4\\n, TSH, estrogen, gonadotropin, cortisol, and ACTH levels. Provocative hormonal\\ntesting may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Once the diagnosis of secondary hormonal\\ndeficiency is established, MRI of the pituitary and hypothalamus is necessary to exclude a tumor or\\nother pathology.\\nDifferential Diagnosis\\nOther problems that can manifest as hypopituitarism include lymphocytic hypophysitis involving\\nlymphocytic infiltration into the pituitary; hemochromatosis, where iron is deposited into the\\npituitary; and exogenous causes such as radiation or surgery in that area.\\nComplications\\nUntreated Sheehan’s syndrome can lead to persistent hypotension, tachycardia, failure to lactate, and\\nhypoglycemia.\\nTreatment\\nAll deficient hormones must be replaced.

A transient form of DI during\\npregnancy has been observed with increasing frequency and has been attributed to excessive placental\\nproduction of vasopressinase, perhaps decreased hepatic clearance, and, because most of the patients\\nreported had abnormal liver function, preeclampsia, fatty liver, or hepatitis. It is possible that some of\\nthese cases represent mild preexisting DI unmasked by pregnancy. It usually resolves several weeks\\nafter delivery but may recur in subsequent pregnancies, so follow-up is recommended.\\nThe incidence during pregnancy has been reported as 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 80,000 deliveries.\\nApproximately 60% of women with previously known DI worsen, 20% improve, and 20% do not\\nchange during pregnancy. Worsening is attributed to excessive placental vasopressinase production.\\nSome women with DI who also develop placental insufficiency show DI improvement, which is\\nattributed to decreased vasopressinase production by the damaged placenta.\\nA variety of lesions may cause DI, such as pituitary surgery, radiation, trauma, tumors,\\ngranulomas, and infections. However, no etiology is found in as many as 50% of patients, and these\\ncases are labeled as “idiopathic.”\\nClinical Findings\\nClinical symptoms include polyuria of 4–15 L/d and intense thirst, particularly for ice-cold fluids. A\\nhigh-normal plasma sodium concentration is suggestive of DI in the patient with polyuria. The\\ndiagnosis of DI is confirmed by the standard water deprivation test. The goal of the water restriction\\ntest is to raise plasma osmolality and to assess for the normal physiologic response to water\\nrestriction. However, this test may prove hazardous during pregnancy because 3–5% of body weight\\nmay be lost during the test. This degree of dehydration, which is required to produce sufficient\\nstimulation for ADH secretion, may lead to uteroplacental insufficiency and fetal distress.

Although brain tumors are not specifically\\nrelated to gestation, meningiomas, angiomas, and neurofibromas are thought to grow more rapidly\\nwith pregnancy. Of the primary neoplasms (half of all brain tumors), gliomas are the most common\\n(50%), with meningiomas and pituitary adenomas accounting for 35%. Of the metastatic cerebral\\ntumors, lung and breast tumors account for 50%. \\nChoriocarcinoma\\n commonly metastasizes to the\\ncerebrum.\\nClinical Findings\\nA. Symptoms & Signs\\nThe clinical manifestations, although dependent on the type and location of the tumor, are generally\\ncharacterized by a slow progression of neurologic signs with evidence of increased intracranial\\npressure. One of the most frequent signs is headache, which must be differentiated from that occurring\\nin tension and in vascular or inflammatory conditions. Pain that is not relieved by analgesics or\\nmuscle relaxants (as a tension headache would be), the absence of a history of migraine headaches,\\nand the lack of signs of infection or meningeal inflammation all point to increased intracranial\\npressure as a possible cause of the headache. Tumors in the pituitary gland or occipital region may be\\nassociated with visual deficits. Other presenting signs and symptoms include nausea, vomiting, double\\nvision, vertigo, seizures, and altered mental status.\\nB. Imaging Studies\\nCT scan and MRI are of greatest assistance in revealing space-occupying lesions. MRI is generally\\npreferred during pregnancy, although fetal radiation exposure from CT of the brain is minimal.\\nC. Laboratory Findings\\nIf the cerebrospinal fluid glucose and protein levels are normal, inflammation or infection of the\\ncentral nervous \\nsystem is unlikely. Similarly, an increase in the cerebrospinal fluid human chorionic\\ngonadotropin (hCG) titer raises the suspicion of metastatic choriocarcinoma. Pleocytosis may be\\npresent with cerebral neoplasia, but usually it is lymphocytic or monocytic, without an increase in the\\nnumber of polymorphonucleocytes. Finally, failure to find blood or xanthochromic fluid in the\\ncerebrospinal fluid helps in differentiating a neoplasm from a hemorrhagic lesion, unless the tumor\\nhas undergone hemorrhagic necrosis.'),\n",

Anticonvulsants should be used only if seizures have occurred. Steroids can be\\nused to decrease intracranial pressure causing focal neurologic signs or headaches. Deterioration of\\nthe patient’s status in early pregnancy should prompt a discussion about the risks of continuing the\\npregnancy. Nevertheless, most such pregnancies can be carried through successfully. During the\\nsecond trimester, treatment with surgery, chemotherapy, or directed radiation can be started and the\\npregnancy allowed to continue. Later in gestation, maternal treatment can be delayed until delivery.\\nPituitary adenomas can be treated with bromocriptine if visual problems or disabling headaches occur.\\nPrognosis\\nBrain tumors usually do not affect pregnancy or the fetus unless the neoplasm leads to early delivery\\nor maternal death.

Women with\\nclassic migraine (migraine with aura) may experience their initial onset during pregnancy.\\nClinical Findings\\nMost often, the patient has a history of migraine headaches, which usually are described as\\n“pounding” and may settle in the eyes, the temporal region, or occiput. The pain can be unilateral or\\nbilateral. Frequently, migraines are associated with gastrointestinal complaints (eg, nausea, vomiting,\\nand diarrhea) or with systemic symptoms (eg, vertigo or syncope). Light sensitivity (photophobia) and\\nnoise sensitivity (sonophobia) often accompany the pain. An aura may or may not precede the\\nheadache. Aura is characterized by focal neurologic symptoms, most commonly visual changes, that\\nare fully reversible. Sleep often aborts the attack.\\nThe diagnosis of migraine headaches usually is made clinically by the characteristics of the pain,\\nassociated symptoms, event triggers (see below), and absence of neurologic signs. Tension and\\ncaffeine withdrawal headaches typically are associated with bandlike pressure pain. If vertigo is\\nassociated with migraine headaches, it is important to rule out Ménière’s disease (labyrinthitis). In the\\nlatter, vertigo is accompanied by tinnitus, a fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss, and nystagmus. If\\nvertigo is associated with ataxia of gait, it is almost always central in origin, in which case head\\ntrauma, brain tumors, seizure disorders, and multiple sclerosis must be excluded. Syncope (fainting)\\nmay occur with migraine or vascular headaches and is common during pregnancy. However, when\\nsyncope occurs with migraine headache, it usually is associated with vertigo.

It is important to visualize\\nthe optic disk to ensure that cerebrospinal fluid pressure is not increased. In cases where the disk\\nborders are not sharp, \\npseudotumor cerebri\\n or an intracranial mass lesion should be considered first.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of migraine headaches initially includes identification of any trigger that precipitates\\nattacks, followed by avoidance of those triggers. Common triggers for some migraine patients include\\nmissing meals, stress, aged cheeses, sausage or other nitrates, chocolate, citrus fruit, wine and other\\nsulfites, monosodium glutamate, strong odors, lights or glare, and inadequate sleep. When this\\nenvironmental manipulation fails to control migraines, drug therapy is indicated. Migraine therapy is\\neither abortive or prophylactic depending on the frequency and severity of attacks. Preferred abortive\\nmedications during pregnancy include acetaminophen, acetaminophen and codeine or other narcotics,\\nand magnesium. The following are more effective migraine abortive medications but are not preferred\\nduring pregnancy: butalbital, isometheptene, caffeine, aspirin, \\nnaproxen, ibuprofen, and triptan drugs\\n(eg, sumatriptan). The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should not be used for prolonged periods\\nand should be avoided in the third trimester because of possible oligohydramnios or premature closure\\nof the ductus arteriosus. Prophylactic medications should be instituted if abortive therapy is only\\npartially effective and if disabling migraines are occurring more than once per week. Options include\\nbeta mimetic blockers, low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, magnesium,\\nriboflavin, and topiramate. Valproic acid or divalproate should be avoided in pregnancy.\\nPrognosis\\nMigraine headaches usually have no deleterious long-term effect on mother or fetus, and treatment of\\nacute exacerbation usually is successful.\\nEPILEPSY & SEIZURE DISORDERS\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n Epilepsy is defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures.\\n Seizures associated with epilepsy can be generalized convulsive (tonic-clonic or grand mal),\\ncomplex partial (loss of awareness or staring with mild motor movements), focal motor or sensory\\n(jacksonian with no loss of awareness), absence or petit mal (brief eye blinking with no postictal\\nconfusion), myoclonic jerks, or auras of déjà vu, fear, or abnormal odors.\\nThe onset of epilepsy is not increased during pregnancy. More than 95% of patients who have seizures\\nduring pregnancy have a history of epilepsy or have been receiving anti-convulsant therapy. Patients\\nwhose seizures are adequately controlled are not likely to experience a deterioration of their condition\\nduring pregnancy. On the other hand, patients who have experienced frequent and uncontrolled\\nseizures before pregnancy likely will experience the same pattern, particularly during early pregnancy.\\nClinical Findings\\nA detailed history from the patient and observers helps to distinguish true seizures from other forms\\nof loss of consciousness, such as syncopal episodes, hysteric attacks, or hyperventilation.

Non–central nervous system causes, such as hypoxia,\\nhypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia, also must be excluded. Finally, seizures may result\\nfrom drug withdrawal, medications, or exposure to toxic substances; thus, appropriate physical\\nexamination and screening for toxic substances are important in patients suffering an apparent first\\nseizure during pregnancy.\\nDetailed neurologic workup is required in patients whose first seizure occurs during pregnancy.\\nElectroencephalogram (EEG), CT scan with shielding or MRI, and lumbar puncture are useful for\\ndetailing the cause of the seizure and are not contraindicated during pregnancy. In established\\nepilepsy, EEG is useful to confirm the type of epilepsy and therefore provide the appropriate drug\\ntherapy.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of epilepsy should consist of the medication that has been most beneficial for the patient\\nand at the lowest possible dose to maintain seizure control with some caveats. Some antiepileptic\\nagents are more likely to cause birth defects than are others, and attempts to change medications\\nshould be made prior to conception.\\nDuring pregnancy, anticonvulsant levels change as a result of decreased protein binding, increased\\nplasma volume, and alterations in the absorption and excretion of drugs. In addition, lamotrigine,\\nphenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine have an increased plasma clearance that probably is\\nrelated to high hepatic metabolism. These factors most often lead to low antiseizure plasma levels.\\nNoncompliance, morning sickness, and hyperemesis gravidarum are other reasons for low drug levels.\\nTherefore, blood level measurements of antiseizure medications are used to monitor and maintain a\\ntherapeutic range. Levels should be checked at least each trimester and prior to delivery. More\\nfrequent monitoring may be needed. Because of decreased protein binding, serum-free drug levels\\nrather than routine serum levels will be more accurate. Breakthrough seizures can result from poor\\nsleep in the third trimester because the patient cannot obtain a comfortable sleeping position. For\\npatients with refractory seizures while taking medication, an attempt should be made to maximize the\\ndosage and the level of 1 medication before switching or adding another agent.\\nIn patients with status epilepticus, control of seizures is mandatory for the safety of the patient and\\nfetus. Lorazepam 2 mg intravenous (IV) push followed by 2 mg IV every minute up to 0.1 mg/kg is\\nfirst-line treatment. If seizures continue, phenytoin 20 mg/kg slow IV push at a rate of 50 mg/min or\\nfosphenytoin 20 phenytoin equivalents/kg IV at 150 phenytoin equivalents/min can be given\\nintravenously. General anesthesia can be considered if seizures persist. In these cases, cerebral edema\\nalmost invariably is present and may be reduced with dexamethasone, mannitol, or hyperventilation.\\nMany cases of status epilepticus in pregnancy are the result of inadequate treatment with antiepileptic\\ndrugs, abrupt withdrawal of phenobarbital or benzodiazepines, noncompliance, or failure to monitor\\nserum levels.\\nAntiepileptic drugs and seizures can negatively affect a fetus. Seizures can cause maternal and fetal\\ninjury, \\nspontaneous abortion, premature labor, and fetal bradycardia. All antiepileptic drugs cross the\\nplacenta, equilibrate rapidly in cord blood, and may have teratogenic effects. The risk of anomalies\\namong infants exposed to anticonvulsants is approximately 2-fold greater than in the general\\npopulation. The previous thinking that women with seizure disorders had an increased risk of fetal\\nmalformations even without exposure to anticonvulsant medication has been disproved. The most\\ncommon defects fall into 2 categories: major and minor malformations. Major malformations include\\norofacial clefts, neural tube defects, and congenital heart disease. Minor malformations consist of'),\n",

It affects 3–5% of exposed offspring. It is characterized by\\nmental retardation, small for gestational age size, craniofacial anomalies, and limb defects. A milder\\nphenytoin-associated syndrome may be present at a greater frequency (8–15%) but is detectable only\\nby careful assessment during the first 3 years of life. Use of trimethadione in pregnancy has been\\nabandoned given the high rate of anomalies (up to 30%) associated with intrauterine trimethadione\\nexposure.\\nThe teratogenic potential of specific antiepileptic agents has been the subject of much debate.\\nProspective pregnancy registries have been established around the world to clarify the risks. The older\\nanticonvulsants—ethosuximide, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, valproic acid, primidone, and\\nphenytoin—are all pregnancy category D because of known increased risk of birth defects in exposed\\nfetuses. Neural tube defects are most common with carbamazepine (0.5–1%) and valproic acid (1–\\n2%). The North American AED (antiepileptic drug) Pregnancy Registry has determined that the\\noverall major malformation rate with exposure to valproic acid is 10.7%. Other pregnancy registries\\nand studies have found the teratogenic potential of valproic acid increases with doses higher than 1000\\nmg/d or levels higher than 70 μg/mL. Besides neural tube defects, hypospadia, polydactyly, and\\nkidney and heart malformation have been associated with valproic acid, so its use during pregnancy\\nshould be avoided if possible. Phenobarbital, previously believed to be safe during pregnancy, has a\\nmalformation rate of 6.5%, which is slightly higher than the approximately 3% rate of other\\nantiepileptic drugs such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and lamotrigine. Less human data on the newer\\nantiepileptic drugs are available, with the exception of lamotrigine and oxcarbazepine. All newer\\nantiepileptic drugs are category C, but more data are needed before they can be deemed safe.\\nTreatment with 2 or more antiseizure medications approximately doubles the risk for\\nmalformations.\\nWomen with existing seizure disorders who are contemplating pregnancy should be tested to\\ndetermine whether they still require anticonvulsant therapy—particularly if anticonvulsants were\\nstarted during childhood or if the patient has been seizure-free for 2–5 years. If a pregnant woman\\nrequires seizure medication, she should be informed of the likelihood of fetal anomalies associated\\nwith each drug, and a discussion regarding the risks and benefits of attempting to switch to a different\\nor safer drug, if available, should ensue. The patient should be counseled regarding folic acid\\nsupplementation (4 mg/d) starting at least 3 months preconceptionally to possibly reduce the chance\\nof neural tube defects.\\nIf the patient is taking an antiseizure medication metabolized by the P450 liver enzyme system, she\\nshould take vitamin K 10 mg/d from week 36 until delivery to prevent hemorrhage in her baby. This is\\nin addition to the intramuscular vitamin K the infant will receive after delivery.\\nAntiepileptic drugs pass into the breast milk to varying degrees, depending on protein-binding\\ncharacteristics. The benefits of breast milk usually outweigh the small risk from the medication to the\\ninfant. If a breastfed infant is too sedated and not feeding well, presumably from the medication in the\\nbreast milk, breastfeeding should be suspended and supplanted with formula.\\nMothers with frequent seizures must be counseled on seizure and infant safety.

The cause is not known, but\\npossible etiologies include environmental, viral, and genetic.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe 2 patterns of disease are relapsing remitting and primary progressive. Findings include weakness\\nin the extremities, sensory loss, difficulty with coordination, and visual problems. Increased reflexes,\\nspasticity, and bladder control \\nproblems develop over time. Myasthenia gravis should be ruled out\\nwith an anticholinesterase (neostigmine) challenge and acetylcholine receptor antibody testing.\\nGuillain-Barré syndrome should be ruled out if the patient has a history of recent viral infection.\\nLaboratory tests and imaging should be performed to rule out other possible etiologies. Serum\\nshould be checked for vitamin B\\n12\\n, Lyme and HTLV-1 (human T-cell lympho-tropic virus type 1)\\ntiters, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), ANA, and rheumatoid factor. An MRI would reveal\\nlesions (plaques) in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Active plaques would enhance with\\ncontrast materials. An elevated level of immunoglobulin (Ig) G in the cerebro-spinal fluid is virtually\\ndiagnostic.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment options include interferon beta-1a, interferon beta-1b, and glatiramer. These medications\\ndecrease relapse rates, decrease disease activity as measured by serial MRI, and decrease disease\\nprogression. The interferon beta-1b and -1a multiple sclerosis trials showed an increased rate of\\nspontaneous abortions of exposed fetuses. Although the increased rate did not reach statistical\\nsignificance, there is good reason for caution. In patients planning to become pregnant, interferon\\ntreatment should be switched to glatiramer until conception and then discontinued once pregnancy is\\nestablished. Symptomatic treatment of spasticity, pain, fatigue, and bowel and bladder dysfunction\\nwill be required as well. IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) has been used in the postpartum period to\\ndecrease the risk of exacerbation with some success. Short courses of corticosteroids may be helpful if\\nthe patient has optic neuritis or other disabling relapse.\\nPrognosis\\nThe disease is characterized by exacerbations and remissions, with 70% of patients experiencing slow\\nprogression over a number of years. Pregnancy does not appear to exert any deleterious effect on\\nmultiple sclerosis and may improve the rate of exacerbation. The risk of exacerbations is increased in\\nthe first 3 months postpartum.

Weakness usually increases as the muscles are used repeatedly.\\nPatients who may not have noticeable symptoms in the morning may be easily diagnosed in the\\nafternoon. Difficulties with swallowing and speech are not uncommon, and the facial muscles are\\nalmost always affected.\\nThe diagnosis can be confirmed by administering edrophonium (Tensilon; a total of 10 mg,\\nconsisting of 2 mg followed by 8 mg 45 seconds later) to assess improvement in muscular weakness.\\nA radioimmunoassay for the acetylcholine receptor antibody can be performed. Repetitive nerve\\nstimulation would show a decrement >15% in a person with the condition.\\nOne-third of patients with myasthenia gravis experience exacerbation during pregnancy, one-third\\ndo not experience a change in disease, and one-third experience remission during pregnancy. The\\ndisease does not affect uterine activity because the uterus consists of smooth muscle. The length of\\nlabor is not affected. However, an assisted second stage might be considered because of maternal\\nfatigue. Exacerbations are most common during the postpartum period. Placental transfer of\\nacetylcholine receptor antibodies can occur, so the fetus should be monitored at frequent intervals\\nduring pregnancy with fetal kick counts and ultrasound. A rare finding in neonates is arthrogryposis\\nmultiplex congenita, congenital contractures secondary to lack of movement in utero.

Diagnosis and therapy should be performed without regard to pregnancy. In\\ngeneral, pregnancy coexisting with trauma to the spinal cord from any cause, even paraplegia,\\nproceeds unremarkably with the exception of an increased frequency of urinary tract infections and\\nsepsis from pressure necrosis of the skin. Fetal growth usually is unimpeded even though initial\\nmaternal weight is frequently <100 lb because of muscular wasting. Generally labor proceeds without\\nevidence of fetopelvic disproportion. Women whose paraplegia is related to anterior horn cell damage\\nor to cord lesions below the tenth thoracic level have appropriate perception of labor contractions and\\nmay require analgesia or anesthesia. In most patients, rapid, painless labors are the rule, with the only\\nabnormality being a prolonged second stage because of decreased muscular effort. Paraplegic patients\\nmay develop autonomic hyperreflexia during labor due to loss of central regulation of the sympathetic\\nnervous system below the level of the lesion. This is best managed with an epidural, continuous\\nmonitoring of the cardiac rhythm and blood pressures, antihypertensives, and an assisted second stage.\\nDISORDERS OF CRANIAL NERVES\\nPalsies of the facial nerve due to inflammation are called \\nBell’s palsy\\n. Although patients may\\ncomplain of paresthesia over the area of paralysis, this is strictly a motor disorder involving paralysis\\nof the muscles of facial expression on 1 side that are innervated by the facial nerve. Given that\\napproximately one-fifth of cases of Bell’s palsy occur during pregnancy or shortly thereafter, it has\\nbeen suggested that pregnancy increases the frequency of this disorder, although viral infections also\\nhave been causally related. Treatment with corticosteroids (prednisone 40–60 mg/d) and acyclovir is\\nhelpful if given within 1 week of onset. However, Bell’s palsy usually is self-limited. Because the\\npatient is unable to blink or close her eye on the affected side, corneal damage will occur if frequent\\neye drops and nighttime closure of the eye with patches and lubrication are not instituted. Rarely is\\nsurgical decompression of the nerve indicated.\\nGUILLAIN-BARRÉ SYNDROME\\nGuillain-Barré syndrome is an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy often related to an\\nupper respiratory or gastrointestinal infection or recent immunization. Rapid onset of weakness\\noccurs, most frequently in an ascending pattern involving the extremities first, then respiratory\\nmuscles and face. Hospitalization is required, and supportive treatment aimed at preventing\\nrespiratory failure is mandatory. If the vital respiratory capacity falls to 800 mL or below,\\ntracheostomy should be performed. Plasmapheresis or IVIG is the treatment of choice to shorten the\\ncourse of illness. Most patients progress normally through pregnancy and deliver at term, so abortion\\nis not mandated.

Women at risk include small\\nwomen with relatively large babies, those who have had midforceps rotations, and those who have had\\nprolonged labor, especially with abnormally large infants (owing to compression of the L4–5\\nlumbosacral nerve trunk).

Most patients\\nwho become pregnant while their SLE is not active for at least 6 months seem to have few problems\\nexcept for a 2- to 3-fold increased risk of superimposed preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction; the\\nrisk of a lupus flare is 20%. Women with active SLE are at very high risk for superimposed\\npreeclampsia (60–80%), fetal growth restriction, preterm birth, and lupus flare (50–80%). Women\\nwith preexisting renal disease frequently have some deterioration in renal function, but it is\\nirreversible in only 10% of cases.\\nTreatment\\nManagement during pregnancy includes a careful history, physical examination, and laboratory\\nevaluation. A history of prior spontaneous abortions or fetal losses should be elicited. The history\\nshould note the manifestations of SLE in the past; determination of the severity of disease activity is\\nimportant in anticipating pregnancy complications. Although the fertility rate of patients with SLE is\\nnormal, patients have a higher percentage of total fetal losses. This may be associated with the\\npresence of antiphospholipid antibodies. Physical examination should focus on signs of active disease.\\nLaboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count, serum chemistries, and liver function\\ntests. ANA (if the diagnosis is not previously confirmed), double-stranded DNA, urine protein, C3,\\nC4, and CH\\n50\\n tests should be obtained. Subsequent changes in these values may herald a flare of lupus\\nnephritis. The results of the SS-A, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibody, and anti-β\\n2\\nglycoprotein 1 tests should be known. The presence of SS-A is associated with neonatal lupus,\\nmanifested by cutaneous lesions or congenital heart block. Anticardiolipin antibody and lupus\\nanticoagulant anti-β\\n2\\n glycoprotein 1 tests are associated with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome\\n(APS), which predisposes patients to thromboembolic events, fetal death, fetal growth restriction, and\\npreeclampsia. Prophylactic treatment with daily baby aspirin and heparin is recommended when APS\\nis diagnosed. Diagnostic criteria require a clinical event (as listed earlier) plus a positive lupus\\nanticoagulant result, moderate- to high-titer anticardiolipin antibody (>40 IgG phospholipid units or\\nIgM phospholipid units or >99th percentile for the testing laboratory), or anti-β\\n2\\n glycoprotein 1\\nantibodies (IgG or IgM >99th percentile for the testing laboratory). These tests should be positive on 2\\noccasions 12 weeks apart. Most fetal loss in SLE appears to be due to concomitant APS, which occurs\\nin approximately 30% of patients.\\nDistinguishing between superimposed preeclampsia in the third trimester and an SLE flare often is\\ndifficult. In fact, it is not possible to say with certainty that preeclampsia is not present, but careful\\nconsideration can suggest whether an SLE flare is a contributing factor. In a pregnancy remote from\\nterm, aggressive empiric therapy of presumed SLE may allow significant prolongation of pregnancy.\\nSerial ultrasounds for fetal growth and antenatal testing starting at 32–34 weeks should be\\ninstituted to ensure fetal well-being.

A pregnant woman will lose blood during delivery and the puerperium, and an anemic\\nwoman is at increased jeopardy of blood transfusion and its related complications.\\nDuring pregnancy, the blood volume increases by approximately 50% and the red blood cell mass\\nby approximately 33%. This relatively greater increase in plasma volume results in a lower hematocrit\\nbut does not truly represent anemia.\\nAnemia in pregnancy most commonly results from a nutritional deficiency in either iron or folate.\\nPernicious anemia due to vitamin B\\n12\\n deficiency almost never occurs during pregnancy.

Iron Deficiency Anemia\\nESSENTIALS OF DIAGNOSIS\\n Hypochromic and microcytic anemia with evidence of depleted iron stores\\nPathogenesis\\nIron deficiency is responsible for approximately 95% of the anemias during pregnancy, reflecting the\\nincreased demands for iron. The total body iron consists mostly of (1) iron in hemoglobin\\n(approximately 70% of total iron; approximately 1700 mg in a 56-kg woman) and (2) iron stored as\\nferritin and hemosiderin in reticuloendothelial cells in bone marrow, the spleen, and parenchymal\\ncells of the liver (approximately 300 mg). Small amounts of iron exist in myoglobin, plasma, and\\nvarious enzymes. The absence of hemosiderin in the bone marrow indicates that iron stores are\\ndepleted. This finding is both diagnostic of anemia and an early sign of iron deficiency. Subsequent\\nevents are a decrease in serum iron, an increase in serum total iron-binding capacity, and anemia.\\nDuring the first half of pregnancy, iron requirements may not be increased significantly, and iron\\nabsorbed from food (approximately 1 mg/d) is sufficient to cover the basal loss of 1 mg/d.

Data published by\\nthe Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences show that pregnancy increases a\\nwoman’s iron requirements to approximately 3.5 mg/d. This need outstrips the 1 mg/d of iron\\navailable from the normal diet.\\nPrevention\\nIt is unclear whether the well-nourished, nonanemic woman benefits from routine iron\\nsupplementation during pregnancy.

However, this requirement increases during pregnancy.\\nIn order to meet this need and to decrease the neural tube defects associated with folate deficiency, a\\ndietary supplement of at least 400 mg/d of folic acid is recommended.\\nAdditional folic acid may be required in states of heightened DNA synthesis, such as multifetal\\ngestation. Similarly, patients with a chronic hemolytic anemia such as \\nsickle cell anemia\\n require\\nadditional folate supplementation in order to meet the demand imposed by increased hematopoiesis.\\nOther hemolytic states are also commonly complicated by folic acid deficiency, including \\nhereditary\\nspherocytosis\\n and \\nmalaria\\n.\\nFolic acid absorption or metabolism may be impaired by the use of oral contraceptives,\\npyrimethamine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, primidone, phenytoin, or barbiturates. Alcohol\\nconsumption also interferes with folate metabolism. Jejunal bypass surgery for obesity or the\\nmalabsorption syndrome (sprue) may impair folic acid absorption.\\nMegaloblastic anemia may also be caused by vitamin B\\n12\\n deficiency.

Pregnant women with sickle\\ncell disease face increased rates of maternal mortality and morbidity from \\nhemolytic and folic acid\\ndeficiency anemias, frequent crises, pulmonary complications, congestive heart failure, infection, and\\npreeclampsia–eclampsia. It is encouraging, however, that maternal mortality has decreased to 1%\\nsince 1972. There is an increased incidence of early fetal wastage, stillbirth, preterm delivery, and\\nfetal growth restriction. The course of pregnancy is generally more benign in women with hemoglobin\\nSC disease than women with sickle cell disease.\\nTreatment\\nPreconception counseling is essential in women with sickle cell disease to optimize the patient’s\\nhealth prior to conception. Many women with sickle cell disease are treated with hydroxyurea.\\nHydroxyurea use in pregnancy has been associated with fetal structural malformations in animals and\\nis poorly studied in humans. Therefore, it should be discontinued prior to conception. Assessment of\\npreconception health includes maternal echocardiogram to evaluate ejection fraction and to look for\\nsigns of pulmonary hypertension. Type and screen should also be tested for any sign of\\nalloimmunization. Many women with sickle cell disease have a history of multiple blood transfusions,\\nwhich puts them at risk of development of alloantibodies that could affect the fetus.\\nAdditionally, preconception or prenatal genetic counseling is of great importance. If both partners\\nhave the gene for S hemoglobin, their offspring have a 1 in 4 chance of having sickle cell anemia. If it\\nis determined that a fetus is at risk of hemoglobinopathy, chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis\\ncan diagnose these disorders in the fetus. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis using single-blastomere\\nDNA analysis prior to in vitro fertilization has allowed for the successful transfer of unaffected\\nembryos.\\nOptimal prenatal care, including prevention or rapid treatment of complications, is necessary to\\nincrease the chance for a good outcome. Pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine has been shown to reduce\\nthe incidence of pneumococcal infection in adults with sickle disease and therefore is highly\\nrecommended. This vaccine is not contraindicated in pregnancy. Similarly, influenza vaccine should\\nbe administered annually. Folic acid 1 mg/d will prevent megaloblastic anemia, which can result from\\nintense hematopoiesis. Serial ultrasonic evaluations are essential to assess fetal growth. Antepartum\\ntesting should begin at 32–34 weeks’ gestation. Careful surveillance for asymptomatic bacteriuria and\\ndemonstration of cure is important for preventing pyelonephritis. Regional anesthesia can be safely\\nadministered to patients with sickle cell disease while they are in labor.\\nIn the management of crises, the most common predisposing factors—infection, dehydration, and\\nhypoxia—should be evaluated and treated. Symptomatic treatment of pain crisis consists of IV fluid,\\noxygen supplementation, and adequate analgesics (eg, morphine). Bacterial pneumonia or\\npyelonephritis must be treated vigorously with IV antibiotics. Streptococcal pneumonia is common\\nand is a serious complication. In all cases, adequate oxygenation must be maintained by face mask as\\nnecessary.\\nThe concentration of hemoglobin S should be <50% of the total hemoglobin to prevent crisis.\\nBlood transfusion should be considered in cases of a fall in hematocrit to <25%, but this decision must\\nbe guided by the individual patient history and her status during pregnancy.

The high incidence in these regions may represent a balanced\\npolymorphism due to heterozygous advantage.\\nAll thalassemias are inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The 2 major groups are the alpha-\\nand beta-thalassemias, both of which affect the synthesis of hemoglobin A, which contains 2 α and 2 β\\nchains. The severity of the anemia varies with the type of hemoglobin abnormality.\\nAlpha-thalassemia is due to defective production of α-globin chains, resulting in a relative excess\\nof β-globin chains. In beta-thalassemia, hemoglobin β-chain synthesis is defective, but the α chains\\nare produced normally. In both cases, the unbalanced synthesis results in a relative excess of the\\nnormally produced chain. The normal globin chains then form tetramers that precipitate within red\\nblood cell precursors in the bone marrow, resulting in ineffective \\nerythropoiesis, red cell sequestration\\nand destruction, and hypochromic anemia. The most severe forms of this disorder may cause\\nintrauterine or childhood death. A person who is heterozygous, or a carrier, for a thalassemia trait may\\nbe asymptomatic.\\nClinical findings\\nA. Alpha-Thalassemia\\nNormally, a patient has 4 functional α-globin genes. Disease severity with alpha-thalassemia varies\\ndepending on how many genes are absent or mutated.\\n1. Alpha-thalassemia-2 trait is seen when 1 of the 4 genes is absent. These patients are not anemic,\\ndo not have microcytic red cells, and have a normal hemoglobin electrophoresis.\\n2.

Hemoglobin\\nelectrophoresis demonstrates 5–30% hemoglobin H.\\n4. Hemoglobin Barts is seen with loss of all 4 α-globin genes. This condition is not compatible with\\nextrauterine life. It is associated with fetal hydrops and intrauterine fetal demise.\\nMaternal hemoglobin H is generally diagnosed prior to pregnancy. Alpha-thalassemia-2 trait and\\nalpha-thalassemia minor may not be diagnosed prior to pregnancy and are relevant in that if the father\\nis a carrier of thalassemia or another hemoglobinopathy, the fetus at risk for significant disease. If the\\nfetus is at risk for thalassemia, prenatal diagnosis is available via DNA testing of fetal cells obtained\\nfrom amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is also available\\nfor couples at risk of having a fetus with severe alpha-thalassemia who are undergoing in vitro\\nfertilization.\\nB. Beta-Thalassemia\\nBeta-thalassemia results from impaired β-globin chain production. \\nBeta-thalassemia major\\n is the\\nhomozygous state, in which there is little or no production of β-chains. At birth, the neonate usually is\\nasymptomatic because fetal hemoglobin F (α\\n2\\nγ\\n2\\n) contains no β-globin chain. However, this protection\\ndisappears at birth, when fetal hemoglobin production terminates. At approximately 1 year of age, a\\nbaby with defective β-globin production usually begins to show signs of thalassemia (anemia,\\nhepatosplenomegaly) and requires frequent blood transfusions. Affected individuals often die in their\\nlate teens or early 20s because of congestive heart failure, often related to myocardial hemosiderosis\\nand liver failure. However, improved treatment with transfusion and iron chelation has led to overall\\nimproved survival and even to successful pregnancies in women with beta-thalassemia major.\\nBeta-thalassemia minor\\n, the heterozygous state, is frequently diagnosed only after the patient\\nfails to respond to iron therapy or delivers a baby with homozygous disease. Such patients usually\\nsuffer from mild to moderate hypochromic microcytic anemia, with increased red blood cell count,\\nelevated hemoglobin A\\n2\\n (α\\n2\\nδ\\n2\\n) concentrations, increased serum iron levels, and iron saturation >20%,\\nalthough hemoglobin electrophoresis may miss a small percentage of patients with beta-thalassemia\\nminor.\\nSuspected adult cases of thalassemia are diagnosed by hemoglobin electrophoresis. As with alpha-\\nthalassemia, antenatal diagnosis of beta-thalassemia is possible. Molecular hybridization measures the\\nnumber of intact α-globin structural genes in fetal cells obtained by amniocentesis. Preimplantation\\ngenetic diagnosis allows for the transfer of unaffected embryos after in vitro fertilization.\\nLYMPHOMA & LEUKEMIA\\n1. Hodgkin’s Lymphoma\\nHodgkin’s lymphoma (previously known as Hodgkin’s disease) is the most common lymphoma to\\naffect women of childbearing age.

However, some procedures, such as staging\\nlaparotomy, after the first trimester impose risks to the pregnancy.\\nComplications\\nComplications associated with Hodgkin’s lymphoma during pregnancy are related to treatment of the\\ndisease, not the disease itself. Chemotherapy during the first trimester is associated with an increased\\nrisk of fetal structural malformation. During the second and third trimesters, chemotherapy is\\nassociated with intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, stillbirth, and adverse fetal\\nneurodevelopmental outcomes \\nsuch as mental retardation and learning disabilities. Children exposed\\nto chemotherapy in utero appear to be at increased risk of cancer themselves.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment is tailored to the individual based on the extent of disease and the gestational age.\\nRadiotherapy is an effective treatment option if radiation scatter to the fetus can be minimized.\\nChemotherapy is relatively safe later in gestation but best avoided in the first trimester if the clinical\\nsituation allows. Pregnancy termination is an alternative if Hodgkin’s lymphoma is diagnosed early in\\ngestation. Although pregnancy itself does not appear to adversely affect the lymphoma, pregnancy\\ntermination permits the aggressive radiotherapy and chemotherapy often necessary. Conversely, if the\\ndiagnosis is made later in gestation and the patient is asymptomatic, delaying therapy until fetal lung\\nmaturity is established may be reasonable.\\nWomen with Hodgkin’s lymphoma are extremely susceptible to infection and sepsis. Sequelae of\\ntreatment include radiation pneumonitis causing restrictive lung disease, pericarditis leading to\\ncongestive heart failure, hypothyroidism, and ovarian failure. Given that 85% of relapses in Hodgkin’s\\nlymphoma occur within 2 years, it is generally accepted that pregnancy should be deferred for 2 years\\nfollowing remission. The risk of second malignancies, especially leukemia, is dramatically increased.\\n2. Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma\\nUntil recently, non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas were encountered infrequently in pregnancy. However,\\nbecause 5–10% of individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) will develop a\\nlymphoma, the incidence of non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas is rising. Similar to Hodgkin’s lymphoma,\\nextensive staging is essential. Treatment with radiotherapy is indicated for localized disease, whereas\\nchemotherapy is used for more extensive disease. Care of the pregnant patient with lymphoma\\nrequires a multidisciplinary approach by obstetrician-gynecologists, hematologic oncologists,\\nperinatologists, and neonatologists. With careful treatment, the fetuses of affected women appear to\\ntolerate treatment of lymphoma quite well.\\n3.

Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura\\nIn ITP, also called \\nidiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura\\n, platelet destruction is secondary to a\\ncirculating immunoglobulin (Ig) G antiplatelet antibody that crosses the placenta and may affect fetal\\nplatelets.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe maternal clinical picture varies from asymptomatic to minor bruises or petechiae, bleeding from\\nmucosal sites, or rarely fatal intracranial bleeding. Splenomegaly may be present. In the peripheral\\ncirculation, the platelet count often is between 80,000 and 160,000/μL, but it may be lower.

Fortunately, only approximately 10% of infants born to women with ITP have\\nplatelet counts less than 50,000/μL at birth. Antepartum identification of severely affected fetuses has\\nproved difficult. Maternal and fetal platelet counts do not correlate well, nor do levels of maternal\\nantiplatelet antibody and fetal platelet levels.

Glucocorticoids\\nsuppress the phagocytic activity in the splenic monocyte-macrophage system, increasing platelet\\nlevels in approximately two-thirds of patients.

Pregnancy and the\\npuerperium are periods of increased risk for these events because they are hypercoagulable states.\\nIndeed, all the elements of \\nVirchow’s triad\\n (circulatory stasis, vascular damage, and\\nhypercoagulability of blood) are present. Increased venous capacity during pregnancy coupled with\\ncompression of large veins by the gravid uterus causes venous stasis. Endothelial damage occurs at\\ndelivery and is more extensive after caesarean delivery, contributing to the increased risk of VTE after\\ncaesarean section. Coagulation is favored during pregnancy due to estrogen stimulation of coagulation\\nfactors and decreased activity of the fibrinolytic.\\nInherited thrombophilias such as \\nactivated protein C resistance\\n (most commonly due to the\\nfactor V Leiden\\n mutation), prothrombin gene mutation, \\nantithrombin III deficiency\\n, and \\nprotein C\\nand protein S deficiency\\n, along with acquired thrombophilias such as the \\nantiphospholipid\\nsyndrome (APS\\n), have emerged as important risk factors for VTE.

Superficial Thrombophlebitis\\nPatients with thrombosis of the superficial veins of the saphenous system present with tenderness,\\npain, or erythema along a vein.

Of note, the superficial femoral vein belongs to the deep venous\\nsystem despite its name. A thrombus in this vein requires treatment for DVT.\\n2. Deep Vein Thrombosis\\nApproximately half of DVT in pregnancy occurs antepartum and half occurs postpartum. Previous\\nclinical practices that contributed to thrombosis, such as prolonged postpartum bed rest, likely falsely\\nelevated the risk of DVT in the puerperium. Greater than 80% of DVT in pregnancy occurs in the left\\nlower extremity rather than the right, a finding attributed to compression of the left iliac vein by the\\nright iliac artery as it branches off the aorta.\\nClinical Findings\\nThe presentation of DVT is variable but frequently includes lower extremity tenderness, swelling,\\ncolor changes, and a palpable cord. \\nHoman’s sign\\n, pain elicited by passive dorsiflexion of the foot,\\nmay be present. Occasionally, the extremity is pale and cool with decreased pulses due to reflex\\narterial spasm.\\nDiagnosis\\nThe modality of choice for diagnosis of DVT is real-time ultrasound, used with duplex and color\\nDoppler ultrasound. Venography remains the standard but has been largely replaced by the less\\ninvasive diagnostic tests. MRI is used when there is a strong clinical suspicion of thrombus not\\ndetected by ultrasound or if the ultrasound results are equivocal. With MRI, anatomy above the\\ninguinal ligament can be evaluated, as can pelvic blood flow.\\nTreatment\\nAnticoagulation, bed rest, and analgesia are the fundamental treatments of DVT. Ambulation with\\nelastic stockings begins once all symptoms have abated, usually in 7–10 days. Patients are initially\\nanticoagulated with unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin. \\nLow-molecular-weight\\nheparin\\n has a longer half-life and increased bioavailability, making administration easier and\\nanticoagulant response more predictable. It is associated with fewer bleeding problems than\\nunfractionated heparin and does not require laboratory monitoring. In the postpartum state, the patient\\ncan then transition to warfarin. Due to embryopathy and fetal hemorrhage, warfarin is contraindicated\\nduring pregnancy. Antepartum DVT is treated with anticoagulation for the rest of pregnancy and then\\nfor 6–12 weeks postpartum for at least a total of 3–6 months of therapy. DVT occurring postpartum\\nshould be treated with anticoagulation for 3–6 months.\\n3. Pulmonary Embolism\\nPulmonary embolism accounts for approximately 20% of maternal deaths in the United States. Its\\nantepartum and postpartum prevalence are approximately equal, although postpartum pulmonary\\nembolism is associated with higher mortality rates.

Women with lower risk thrombophilias, such as protein C or S\\ndeficiency and heterozygosity for prothrombin gene mutation (G20210A) or factor V Leiden mutation,\\nand\\n a history of thromboembolism should also receive anticoagulation during pregnancy.

Associated signs include tachypnea and\\ntachycardia.\\nDiagnosis\\nInitial evaluation of the symptoms associated with pulmonary embolism usually consists of arterial\\nblood gas measurement, chest radiograph, and electrocardiogram. Ventilation–perfusion scintigraphy\\nmay be used to evaluate for perfusion defects and ventilation mismatches that suggest pulmonary\\nembolus. The test has negligible fetal radiation exposure. High-probability scans are indicative of\\npulmonary embolism in 88% of cases. Conversely, in patients with normal or near-normal scans,\\npulmonary embolism was detected by angiography only 4% of the time. However, the usefulness of\\nthis modality is limited by that fact that the majority of results are reported as intermediate- or low-\\nprobability scans, categories without much diagnostic value. Because of these limitations, spiral\\ncomputed tomographic (CT) pulmonary angiography has emerged as a useful, noninvasive modality\\nfor the detection of pulmonary embolism but is limited in the detection of small emboli. Pulmonary\\nartery catheterization with angiography remains the gold standard but is used less frequently due to its\\ninvasive nature.\\nTreatment\\nTreatment of pulmonary embolism is anticoagulation. Guidelines such as those published by the\\nAmerican College of Chest Physicians (2004) should be followed. The factors influencing\\nanticoagulant choice (heparin vs. warfarin [Coumadin]) are the same as those for DVT. First-line\\ntherapy during pregnancy is adjusted-dose unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin.\\nTherapeutic anticoagulation should be continued for at least 4–6 months to prevent recurrence.

The initial approach to the gynecologic patient and the general diagnostic procedures\\navailable for the investigation of gynecologic complaints are presented here. Although other aspects\\nof the general medical examination are left to other texts, concern for the patient’s total health and\\nwell-being is mandatory.\\nTHE PERIODIC HEALTH SCREENING EXAMINATION\\nIt is now a generally accepted part of the physician’s responsibility to advise patients to have periodic\\nmedical evaluations. The frequency of visits varies according to the patient’s age and specific\\nproblem.\\nThe periodic health screening examination helps detect the following ailments of women that are\\nespecially amenable to early diagnosis and treatment: diabetes mellitus; urinary tract infection or\\ntumor; hypertension; malnutrition or obesity; thyroid dysfunction or tumor; and breast, abdominal, or\\npelvic tumor. These conditions can be detected by a review of systems, with specific questions\\nregarding recent abnormalities or any variation in function. Determination of weight, blood pressure,\\nand urinalysis may reveal variations from the previous examination. An examination of the thyroid\\ngland, breasts, abdomen, and pelvis, including a Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, should then be performed.\\nA rectal examination also is advisable, and a conveniently packaged test for occult blood (Hemoccult)\\nis recommended for patients older than 40 years. Patients of an advanced age (>50 years) may undergo\\nblood test for lipid profile, bone density scan, pelvic ultrasound examination, and mammogram.\\nThe physician should be concerned about conditions other than purely somatic ones. Unless a\\npatient’s problems require the services of a psychiatrist or some other specialist, the doctor should be\\nprepared to act as a counselor and work with the patient during a mutually agreeable time when it is\\npossible to listen to her problems without being hurried and to give support, counsel, and other kinds\\nof help as required.\\nHISTORY\\nTo adequately evaluate the gynecologic patient, it is important to establish a rapport during the history\\ntaking. The patient needs to tell her story to an interested listener who does not allow body language\\nor facial expressions to imply disinterest or boredom. One should avoid cutting off the patient’s story,\\nbecause doing so may obscure important clues or other problems that may have contributed to the\\nreasons for the visit.\\nThe following outline varies from the routine medical history because, in evaluating the\\ngynecologic patient, the problem often can be clarified if the history is obtained in the following\\norder.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='Identifying Information\\nA. Age\\nKnowledge of the patient’s age sets the tone for the complaint and the approach to the patient.\\nObviously, the problems and the approach to them vary at different stages in a woman’s life\\n(pubescence, adolescence, childbearing years, and premenopausal and postmenopausal years).\\nB. Last Normal Menstrual Period\\nThe date of onset of the last normal menstrual period (LNMP) is important to define. A missed period,\\nirregularity of periods, erratic bleeding, or other abnormalities may all imply certain events that are\\nmore easily diagnosed when the date of onset of the LNMP is established.\\nC. Gravidity & Parity\\nThe process of taking the patient’s obstetric history is detailed in \\nChapter 6\\n, but the reproductive\\nhistory should be \\nrecorded as part of the gynecologic evaluation. A convenient symbol for recording\\nthe reproductive history is a 4-digit code denoting the number of term pregnancies, premature\\ndeliveries, abortions, and living children (TPAL) (eg, 2-1-1-3 means 2 term pregnancies, 1 premature\\ndelivery, 1 abortion, and 3 living children).\\nChief Complaint\\nThe chief complaint usually is best elicited by asking “What kind of problem are you having?” or\\n“How can I help you?” It is important to listen carefully to the way the patient responds to this\\nquestion and to allow her to fully explain her complaint. The patient should be interrupted only to\\nclarify certain points that may be unclear.\\nPresent Illness\\nEach of the problems the patient describes must be obtained in detail by questioning regarding what\\nexactly the problem is, where exactly the problem is occurring, the date and time of onset, whether the\\nsymptoms are abating or getting worse, the duration of the symptoms when they do occur, and how\\nthese symptoms are related to or influence other events in her life. For example, the site, duration, and\\nintensity of pain must be accurately described. Getting a sense of how the pain affects her life often is\\nhelpful in evaluating the intensity of pain: “Does the pain prevent you from standing or walking?”\\nIt is important to maintain eye contact with the patient and to listen to every word. Do not rely on a\\npatient’s sophistication as a measure of her knowledge of anatomy and medical terminology. It is\\nimportant for the physician to judiciously adjust the level of terminology according to the patient’s\\nknowledge and vocabulary. Communicating with the patient in this manner may help the physician\\nobtain an accurate history and establish rapport.\\nIn addition to physiologic events and the life cycle, symptoms described could be related to starting\\na new job, the beginning of a new relationship or difficulties in the current relationship, an exercise\\nregimen, new medication, and any emotional changes in the patient’s life.\\nPast History\\nAfter the physician is satisfied that all possible information concerning the present illness and the\\nimportant corollaries has been obtained, the past history should be elicited.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='A. Contraception\\nContinuing with the history, it is important to elicit whether the patient is using or needs some form of\\ncontraception. If she is using contraception, her level of satisfaction with her chosen method should be\\ndetermined. In patients taking oral contraceptives, the history should reflect the agent and dose,\\nwhether there is a great variation in the time of day she takes her pill, and any impact of the pill on\\nother physiologic functions. Other forms of hormonal contraceptives, including vaginal rings, dermal\\npatches, and injectable contraceptives, have become available and have their own unique issues. It is\\nextremely important to ask questions during the remainder of the history and to key the physical\\nexamination to ascertain whether there are any contraindications to the patient’s current form of\\ncontraception.\\nB. Medications & Habits\\nAny medications, prescribed or otherwise, that are being taken or that were being taken when\\nsymptoms first occurred should be described. Particular attention must be directed to use of\\nhormones, steroids, and other compounds likely to influence the reproductive tract. Herbal\\npreparations may not be viewed by the patient as medications, so this question should be specifically\\nasked. In addition to medications, the patient should be questioned concerning her use of street drugs.\\nIt must be ascertained whether the patient smokes and, if so, how much and for how long. It is\\nimportant to ascertain the amount of alcohol ingested, if any. This questioning provides an ideal time\\nto indicate the health risks of various habits.\\nC. Medical\\nIt is important to discover any history of serious medical and psychiatric illnesses and whether\\nhospitalization was required. Particularly important are illnesses in the major organ systems. It is\\nimportant to know whether there is a major endocrinopathy in the patient’s history. Notable weight\\ngain or loss prior to the onset of the patient’s current symptoms should be detailed. Other important\\ndetails include when she had her last physical examination, including pelvic examination and Pap\\nsmear.\\nD. Surgical\\nThe surgical history includes all operations, the dates performed, and associated postoperative or\\nanesthetic complications.\\nE. Allergies\\nQuestioning should continue relating any possible allergic reactions to drugs or specific foods. The\\nreaction produced (eg, rash, gastrointestinal upset) must be elicited and the approximate time when it\\noccurred ascertained. Any testing to confirm or deny the observation must be noted. Latex allergy has\\nbecome more common and severe and should be considered prior to most medical procedures, such as\\ndrawing blood samples, pelvic examination, and taking blood pressures.\\nF. Bleeding & Thrombotic Diatheses\\nDetermining whether or not the patient bleeds excessively in relation to prior surgery or minor trauma\\nis important. A history of easy bruising or of bleeding from the gums \\nwhile brushing teeth may be\\nuseful in this judgment. The patient should be asked whether she or one of her close relatives\\nexperienced venous thromboembolism (VTE). A history of VTE may guide the physician as to which\\ntreatment to offer. Suspicion of a bleeding or clotting problem indicates the need for further'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='laboratory evaluation.\\nG. Obstetrics\\nThe obstetric history includes each of the patient’s pregnancies listed in chronologic order. The date\\nof birth; sex and weight of the offspring; duration of pregnancy; length of labor; type of delivery; type\\nof anesthesia; and any complications should be included.\\nH. Gynecologic\\nThe first item in the gynecologic past history is the menstrual history: age at menarche, interval\\nbetween periods, duration of flow, amount and character of flow, degree of discomfort, and age at\\nmenopause. The menstrual history often is an important clue in the diagnosis.\\nA prior history of sexually transmitted disease (STD) needs to be detailed. Although in the past it\\nwas more common to note only gonorrhea and syphilis, it is important to also document exposure to\\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, herpesvirus, chlamydia, and papillomavirus. Any\\ntreatment or admissions to the hospital for treatment of salpingitis, endometritis, or tubo-ovarian\\nabscess must be carefully documented. Attempts to assess the impact of these processes in relation to\\nectopic pregnancy, infertility, and type of contraception must be elicited.\\nAlthough its significance is less than that of the prior stated diseases, the occurrence of episodes of\\nvaginitis should not be dismissed. Their frequency and the medications used to treat them should be\\ndiscussed. In the case of such infections, it is important to detail whether or not the episode was\\npathologic or merely a misinterpreted physiologic circumstance.\\nI. Sexual\\nThe sexual history should be an integral part of any general gynecologic history. In taking a sexual\\nhistory, the physician must be nonjudgmental and not embarrassed or critical.\\nQuestions that may be covered include the following. Is she currently sexually active? Is the\\nrelationship satisfactory to her and, if not, why not? A question regarding whether the patient is\\nheterosexual or lesbian is important but often difficult to ask because the question may be offensive to\\nsome patients. It is important, however, not to assume that a relationship is heterosexual because a\\nlesbian woman will lose all rapport with the physician when the physician is insensitive to such issues.\\nJ. Social\\nA social history can be an extension of earlier questions pertaining to the marital and sexual history.\\nKnowing the type of work the patient does, the type of educational background, and her community\\nactivities may assist in ascertaining the patient’s relationship to her entire environment.\\nThe patient’s involvement with her own health care should be carefully elicited, including her\\nattention and knowledge concerning diet, health screening examinations, recreation, and the degree of\\nregular physical exercise.\\nFamily History\\nThe patient’s family history must include the state of health of immediate relatives (parents, siblings,\\ngrandparents, and offspring). In addition to listing these relatives, it is useful in cases where genetic\\nillnesses may be apparent to record a 3-generation pedigree.\\nThe incidence of familial heart disease, hypertensive renal or vascular disease, diabetes mellitus\\n(insulin-dependent or non–insulin-dependent), vascular accidents, and hematologic abnormalities\\nshould be ascertained.

PMID: 12449269.\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION\\nThe physical examination is most useful if it is conducted in an environment that is aesthetically\\npleasing to the patient. Adequate gowning and draping assist in preventing embarrassment. Often a\\nphysician’s assistant escorts the patient to the dressing area and gives explicit instructions about what\\nto take off and how to put on her gown and then may assist in draping the patient.\\nA physician may have a female assistant remain in the examining room to assist when necessary,\\nbut whether or not she remains solely as a chaperone depends on local custom and the preference of\\nthe patient and the physician. A chaperone is not legally required, but the physician, male or female,\\nmust use good judgment, especially during the breast and pelvic examinations. If the patient wants her\\npartner, relative, or a friend to be present, the request should \\nbe honored unless, in the physician’s\\njudgment, such an arrangement would interfere with the examination or with obtaining an accurate\\nhistory. It is highly recommended that the physician explain the steps and acts that will be taken,\\nespecially during the pelvic examination when the patient might lack a direct eye contact with the\\nphysician.\\nGeneral Examination\\nIf the gynecologist is the primary care physician for the patient, a general physical examination should\\nbe performed annually or whenever the situation warrants. A complete examination obviously\\nprovides more information, demonstrates the physician’s thoroughness, and establishes rapport with\\nthe patient.\\nGeneral Evaluation\\nA. Vital Signs\\nAs part of every examination—whether for a specific problem, routine annual examination, or a return\\nvisit for a previously diagnosed problem—the patient should be weighed and her blood pressure taken.\\nPostmenopausal patients should have their height measured to document any loss of height from\\nosteoporosis and vertebral fractures. Before the patient empties her bladder for the examination,\\ndetermination should be made as to whether the urine will need to be sent for urinalysis, culture, or'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data\\\\gynaec book.pdf'}, page_content='pregnancy testing.\\nThe examination of the chest should include visual assessment for any skin lesions and symmetry\\nof movement. Auscultation and percussion of the lungs are important for excluding primary\\npulmonary problems such as asthma and pneumonia. The examination of the heart includes percussion\\nfor size and auscultation for arrhythmias and significant murmurs.\\nBreast Examination\\n(See also \\nChapter 5\\n.)\\nBreast examination should be a routine part of the physical examination. Breast cancer will occur\\nin 1 in 8 women in the United States during her lifetime. Physicians who treat women should educate\\npatients on the technique of self-examination, because the well-prepared patient is one of the most\\naccurate screening methods for breast disease.\\nThe physical examination provides an ideal time to ascertain the frequency and methodology of\\nbreast self-examination. It also is an ideal time to teach the patient how to perform breast self-\\nexamination. The patient should be advised to examine herself in the mirror, looking for skin changes\\nor dimpling, and then carefully palpate all quadrants of the breast. Most women prefer to do this with\\nsoapy hands while showering or bathing. The examination should be repeated at the same time each\\nmonth, preferably 1 week after the initiation of the menses, when the breasts are least nodular;\\npostmenopausal women should perform self-examination on the same day each month.\\nThe frequency of mammography or the earlier use of mammography depends on both the\\nindividual woman and her family history. Patients with a positive family history of breast cancer\\nshould have a mammogram at an earlier age, particularly those whose mother, aunt, or sister\\ndeveloped premenopausal breast cancer. In general, a mammogram should be obtained every 1–2\\nyears from ages 40–50 years and annually thereafter. Ultrasonography now can reliably differentiate\\nsolid from cystic lesions; this technique complements but does not supplant mammography. Breast\\nself-examination, physician examination, mammography, and ultrasonography are complementary,\\nand all should be used for the early detection of breast cancer. Annual magnetic resonance imaging\\n(MRI) examination of the breast is indicated only in patients carrying BRCA1/2 mutations or with\\nvery strong familial history of breast cancer. However, this examination is complementary to the other\\ntechniques for early detection of breast cancer and does not replace them.\\nThe correct technique for breast examination is shown in \\nFigure 35–1\\n. If abnormalities are\\nencountered, a decision should be reached concerning the need for mammography (or other imaging\\nmethods) or direct referral to a breast surgeon unless the gynecologist is trained in performing breast\\nbiopsies. Skin lesions, particularly eczematous lesions in the area of the nipple, should be closely\\nobserved; if they are not easily cured by simple measures, they should be biopsied. An eczematous\\nlesion on the nipple or areola may represent Paget’s carcinoma.'),\n",

Inspection should detect irregularity of\\ncontour or color. Auscultation should follow inspection but precede palpation because the latter may\\nchange the character of intestinal activity. Palpation of the entire abdomen—gently at first, then more\\nfirmly as indicated—should detect rigidity, voluntary guarding, masses, and tenderness. If the patient\\ncomplains of abdominal pain or if unexpected tenderness is elicited, the examiner should ask her to\\nindicate the point of maximal pain or tenderness with 1 finger. Suprapubic palpation is designed to\\ndetect uterine, ovarian, or urinary bladder enlargements. A painful area should be left until last for\\ndeep palpation; otherwise, the entire abdomen can be guarded voluntarily. As a final part of the\\nabdominal examination, the physician should carefully check for any abnormality of the abdominal\\norgans: liver, gallbladder, spleen, kidneys, and intestines. In some instances, the demonstration of an\\nabnormality of the abdominal muscle reflexes may be diagnostically helpful. Percussion of the\\nabdomen should be performed to identify organ enlargement, tumor, or ascites.\\nPelvic Examination\\nThe pelvic examination is a procedure feared by many women, so it must be conducted in such a way\\nas to allay \\nher anxieties. A patient’s first pelvic examination may be especially disturbing, so it is\\nimportant for the physician to attempt to allay fear and to inspire confidence and cooperation. The\\nempathic physician usually finds that by the time the history has been obtained and a painless and\\nnonembarrassing general examination performed, a satisfactory gynecologic examination is not a\\nproblem. Relaxing surroundings; a nurse or attendant chaperone if indicated; warm instruments; and a\\ngentle, unhurried manner with continued explanation and reassurance are helpful in securing patient\\nrelaxation and cooperation. This is especially true with the woman who has never before undergone a\\npelvic examination. In these patients, a 1-finger examination and a narrow speculum often are\\nnecessary. In some \\ncases, vaginal examination is not possible; palpation of the pelvic structures by\\nrectal examination is then the only recourse. Occasionally an ultrasound examination may be helpful\\nin ascertaining whether the pelvic organs are normal in size and configuration in patients who cannot\\nadequately relax the abdominal muscles. If a more definitive pelvic examination is essential, it can be\\nperformed with the patient anesthetized.\\nA. External Genitalia (\\nFig. 35–2\\n)\\nThe pubic hair should be inspected for its pattern (masculine or feminine), for the nits of pubic lice,\\nfor infected hair \\nfollicles, and for any other abnormalities. The skin of the vulva, mons pubis, and\\nperineal area should be examined for evidence of dermatitis or discoloration. The glans clitoridis can\\nbe exposed by gently retracting the surrounding skin folds. The clitoris is at the ventral confluence of\\nthe 2 labia; it should be no more than 2.5 cm in length, most of which is subcutaneous. The major and\\nminor labia usually are the same size on both sides, but a moderate difference in size is not abnormal.\\nSmall protuberances or subcutaneous nodules may be either sebaceous cysts or tumors. External\\ncondylomata are often found in this area. The urethra, just below the clitoris, should be the same color\\nas the surrounding tissue and without protuberances. Normally, vestibular (Bartholin’s) glands can be\\nneither seen nor felt, so enlargement may indicate an abnormality of this gland system.

After\\nthe Pap smear is prepared, the vaginal wall is again carefully inspected as the speculum is withdrawn\\n(\\nFig. 35–6\\n). The type of speculum used depends on the preference of the physician, but the most\\nsatisfactory instrument for the sexually active patient is the Pederson speculum, although the wider\\nGraves speculum may be necessary to afford adequate visualization (\\nFig. 35–7\\n). For the patient with a\\nsmall introitus, the narrow-bladed Pederson speculum is preferable. When more than the usual\\nexposure is necessary, an extra large Graves speculum is available. To visualize a child’s vagina, a\\nHuffman or nasal speculum, a large otoscope, or a Kelly air cystoscope is invaluable.\\nNext, the vagina is palpated; unless the patient’s introitus is too small, the index and middle fingers\\nof either hand are inserted gently and the tissues palpated. The vaginal walls should be smooth,\\nelastic, and nontender.\\nFigure 35–6\\n.

Recent evidence has revealed an unacceptably wide range of\\nsensitivity among strategies aimed at checking the feces for occult blood, with some practices and\\ntests performing so poorly that the large majority of prevalent cancers are missed at the time of\\nscreening. Therefore, a single stool sample for fecal occult blood testing obtained by digital rectal\\nexamination is not adequate for the detection of CRC and should not be used for CRC screening.\\nFurthermore, it is the physician’s role to encourage patients above 50 years of age or those with\\nfamilial CRC to undergo procedures aimed at prevention of CRC (such as colonoscopy,\\nsigmoidoscopy, or computed tomography [CT] scan) and to not diagnose CRC using methods\\ndetecting occult blood in the stool.\\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. \\nRoutine Pelvic Examination and\\nCervical Cytology Screening.

Other office diagnostic procedures useful in specific situations\\n(eg, tests used in infertility evaluation) can be found in appropriate chapters elsewhere in this book.\\nTests for Vaginal Infection\\nIf abnormal vaginal discharge is present, a sample of vaginal discharge should be scrutinized. A\\nculture is obtained by applying a sterile cotton-tipped applicator to the suspect area and then\\ntransferring the suspect material to an appropriate culture medium. Because this procedure is\\ninconvenient to perform in the physician’s office, most laboratories supply a prepackaged kit that\\nallows the physician to put the cotton-tipped applicator into a sterile container, which is then sent to\\nthe laboratory. The vaginal discharge can also be tested for the vaginal pH. An acidic pH of 4–5 is\\nconsistent with fungal infection, whereas an alkaline pH of 5.5–7 suggests infections such as bacterial\\nvaginosis and \\nTrichomonas\\n. Often an endocervical infection may be perceived as a vaginal infection.\\nObtaining a swab for gonorrhea and chlamydia testing from the endocervix is warranted.\\nA. Saline (Plain Slide)\\nTo demonstrate \\nTrichomonas vaginalis\\n organisms, the physician mixes on a slide 1 drop of vaginal\\ndischarge with 1 drop \\nof normal saline warmed to approximately body temperature. The slide should\\nhave a coverslip. If the smear is examined while it is still warm, actively motile trichomonads usually\\ncan be seen.\\nThe saline slide can also be used to look for the mycelia of the fungus \\nCandida albicans\\n, which\\nappear as segmented and branching filaments. The slide can be useful in looking for bacterial\\nvaginosis by looking for “clue cells,” epithelial cells covered from edge to edge by short coccobacilli-\\ntype bacteria.\\nB. Potassium Hydroxide\\nOne drop of an aqueous 10% potassium hydroxide solution is mixed with 1 drop of vaginal discharge\\non a clean slide and a coverslip applied. The potassium hydroxide dissolves epithelial cells and debris\\nand facilitates visualization of the mycelia of a fungus causing vaginal infection. The slide can be\\nbrought near the nose to determine if the discharge has a “fishy” odor. This odor is strongly suggestive\\nof bacterial vaginosis, a common vaginal infection associated with a mixed anaerobic bacterial flora.\\nIn addition, this same slide with a coverslip can be magnified with a microscope to visualize mycelia\\nthat may have been hidden by debris with just the saline smear.\\nC. Bacterial Infection\\nBacterial infection may be present, especially if there is an ischemic lesion such as occurs after\\nradiation therapy for cervical carcinoma, or if a patient is suspected of having bacterial vaginosis,\\ngonorrhea, or a \\nChlamydia trachomatis\\n infection.

An accurate blood test is available for diagnosis. Prior to drawing\\nthe blood, the physician must discuss with the patient the accuracy of the blood test for diagnosing the\\npresence of HIV.

The frequency of the need for this\\ntest has been recently revised. Epidemiologic statistics have led the US Preventive Services Task\\nForce to recommend that for the average woman who has had 3 normal Pap smears, a Pap test every 2\\nor 3 years is adequate. This recommendation is based on the observation that most cervical cancers are\\nslow growing. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends annual Pap\\nsmear screenings from 3 years after the start of sexual intercourse but no later than age 21 years. For\\nwomen aged 30–64 years, the frequency of screening may be reduced to every 2–3 years after 3\\nconsecutive negative Pap smears. Patients at risk, including women with multiple sexual partners, a\\nhistory of STD, genital condylomata, or prior abnormal Pap smears; women who are receiving\\nimmune suppression therapy; women who are infected with HIV; or women who were exposed to\\ndiethylstilbestrol (DES) in utero, should continue to be screened annually. Women who are HIV\\npositive should have cervical cytology testing every 6 months after diagnosis, \\nand then annually after\\n2 consecutive normal test results. HPV vaccination status does not change theses cervical cytology\\nscreening recommendations. The physician can consider discontinuing cervical cytology at 65–70\\nyears of age if patient has had 3 or more normal results in a row, no abnormal test results in 10 years,\\nno history of cervical cancer, and no history of DES exposure in utero, is HIV negative, is not\\nimmunodepressed, and does not have other risk factors for new acquisition of STDs; if cervical\\ncytology has been discontinued, the physician should review risk factors annually to evaluate the need\\nfor re-initiation of screening.\\nAside from premalignant and malignant changes, other local conditions often can be suspected by\\nthe cytologist.

The speculum is placed in the vagina after it has been lubricated with water only. With\\nthe cervix exposed, a specially designed plastic or wooden spatula is applied to the cervix and rotated\\n360 degrees to abrade the surface slightly and to pick up cells from the squamocolumnar area of the\\ncervical os.

The slide is sent to the laboratory with an identification sheet\\ncontaining pertinent history and findings (see \\nFig. 35–6\\n). Another method called ThinPrep automates\\nthe preparation of the Pap smear slide so that the variability introduced by the clinician preparing the\\nslide itself is no longer a factor. With this method, the specimen is placed in a liquid-based medium\\nand sent to the laboratory.
